1081

neck way out there.

1087
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:15,029
you rowed like no one else
that's ever come through here.

1088
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:16,281
I remember watching you,

1089
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,075
wondering how fast one
of my shells could go

1090
01:00:19,076 --> 01:00:20,911
if there were eight
just like you in it.

that as I'll ever get.

And if I send them out
there and they aren't ready?

1094

Then it's like Tom said.

1095

not have the money

And what if we can't

1614
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:48,551
Well, the committee
would have to find

1615

a suitable replacement
to compete in Berlin.
