00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:31,455
so the Delta Force section
is hard to read.

351
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:32,959
Shh.

352
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:36,665
- Is that gonna hurt my chances?
- Ehh.

353
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,880
- Come here.
- Hmm?

354
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:46,854
They, uh, wear uniforms here.

355
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,923
- Security, so...
- Oh, very cool, yeah.

356
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:51,262
- So I need to just...
- I mean, it's not those...

357
00:19:51,294 --> 00:19:52,430
Whoa!

358
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:54,235
Those maroon things,
like mall security?

359
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:55,737
'Cause I can't rock that look.

360
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,712
Maroon? Like... my dress?

361
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:03,519
No, not like your dress
because that would be sexy.

362
00:20:03,553 --> 00:20:05,222
- No, I'm just saying.
- Fine.

363
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:06,759
Anyway, I...

364
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,230
What's the salary here anyway?

365
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:10,367
ROY ON SPEAKERS: <i>Have any idea?</i>

366
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:11,502
<i>And is there a medical copay?</i>

367
00:20:11,534 --> 00:20:12,737
<i>Because I have a pre-existing,</i>

368
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:14,842
<i>you know, with the combat stuff.</i>

369
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,915
<i>Hey, what do you do here?
It looks really... big.</i>

370
00:20:17,949 --> 00:20:19,585
<i>Been working on it a while?</i>

371
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:21,890
JEMMA: Just long enough, I hope.

372
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,594
ROY: What is that thing anyway?

373
00:20:24,628 --> 00:20:26,799
That's five years' worth
of sleepless nights

374
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:29,738
and round-the-clock research.

375
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:33,045
And it means more to me
than you can possibly imagine.

376
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,481
What does it do?

377
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,219
- What's it do?
- Mm.

378
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:38,957
Unmakes all of time and space...

379
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:44,133
..and destroys the planet in its
entirety, if improperly used.

380
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:45,604
ROY: No shit.

381
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:48,977
<i>Wait. Like, doomsday destroy?</i>

382
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,716
<i>Well, you must</i>

383
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,051
be really stressed!

384
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,922
JEMMA: Mm-hm.

385
00:20:58,095 --> 00:20:59,933
Wow. Look at Joe.

386
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:03,372
Jesus, he's getting
so big, Jemma.

387
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,146
Hey, you mind
if I swap this out?

388
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:10,653
- Huh?
- This... this picture.

389
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,823
You got another one of these?

390
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:15,964
Oh, yeah, sure, you can take it.
What's your weight?

391
00:21:15,998 --> 00:21:17,868
Uh...

392
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:23,178
I'm doing... I'm doing a special
paleo thing, so it's, like, 175.

393
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:25,183
Still drinking?

394
00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:27,186
- Yeah.
- I'll put 180.

395
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:29,658
180.

396
00:21:30,459 --> 00:21:32,330
Have you thought
about telling him?

397
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,639
It would mean a lot to me
if we could tell him, Jemma.

398
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,778
[scoffs] Honestly,
what would he gain?

399
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:42,817
You've been absent
most of his life.

400
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,423
Why do you gotta
say it like that,

401
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,926
like it wouldn't be worth it

402
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,432
if I got to know him now,
you know?

403
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,504
My work took me away
from you guys.

404
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:54,173
- Your work?
- Yeah.

405
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:55,944
Your work?

406
00:21:55,977 --> 00:21:57,813
You loved that life a lot more

407
00:21:57,847 --> 00:22:00,620
than you loved the idea
of sharing one with us.

408
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,723
Getting shot at
is way more exciting

409
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:04,361
than diapers and minivans.

410
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:06,298
Right, right, right, there's
your go-to argument,

411
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,499
and you know that.

412
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:11,674
I'm just an asshole who didn't
wanna stick around, right?

413
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,947
What does it matter
anymore, Roy?

414
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,385
I mean, we've both moved on,
we've made our decision,

415
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,523
and Joe adores you anyway.

416
00:22:18,555 --> 00:22:20,759
- He adores me?
- Yeah.

417
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:23,867
Well, what'd he say about me?

418
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,481
What do you want, Roy?

419
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,292
I lost you, OK?

420
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:40,868
I know that I blew it.
I made my peace with it.

421
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,542
Please don't let
that happen with my son.

422
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:48,016
That's all I'm asking.

423
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,124
He's our boy, Jemma.

424
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:53,626
[door opens]

425
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:55,763
- MAN: Dr Wells.
- Just a minute.

426
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:57,733
Oh, sorry, Brett.

427
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,805
Uh, this is Roy. Roy, Brett.

428
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,209
Brett's head of security
here at Dynow.

429
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,714
Your office is in
a restricted area, Dr Wells,

430
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:06,084
and is therefore off-limits.

431
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,955
I made it clear to the colonel

432
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:11,228
that I would accept visitors
when I deemed it appropriate.

433
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,635
I was just dropping off
my résumé, big guy.

434
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,238
It's all good.

435
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,484
Well, we're not hiring
right now, Captain Pulver.

436
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,455
Tell him I'll be there
in a moment.

437
00:23:25,957 --> 00:23:27,794
The colonel's waiting.

438
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,239
What a dick.

439
00:23:35,243 --> 00:23:36,880
I thought you said
you were hiring.

440
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:39,484
They are. We are.

441
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,025
I am.

442
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,830
What are you talking about?

443
00:23:46,865 --> 00:23:49,905
It's a very specific
security detail.

444
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:51,775
Black bag stuff, like, covert?

445
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,446
Beyond.

446
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:54,915
Really?

447
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,787
When do I start?

448
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,095
[lowly] Sooner than you think.

449
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:05,670
VENTOR: I read the man's résumé
and I see cause for concern.

450
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:07,706
He doesn't look like much.

451
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,878
Well, no-one ever notices
the housefly

452
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:13,186
till he fucks up
a good bowl of soup, Brett.

453
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,724
There's something
I don't like about him.

454
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:20,099
He has that... trait.

455
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:23,072
What trait is that?

456
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:24,875
The overachiever who makes up

457
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:27,114
for a lack of talent
with hustle.

458
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:30,552
The guy in the playground
I grew up hating.

459
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:31,990
Vet his service history.

460
00:24:32,023 --> 00:24:35,430
If it's accurate, I want him
tracked and monitored.

461
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:39,170
If he becomes problematic,
we'll deal with him.

462
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:43,211
And, uh, reach outside
the normal ranks -

463
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:45,149
no-one that could
connect back to us.

464
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:46,985
The more random
the assets, the better.

465
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,859
Find some real freaks.

466
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:51,929
OK, I'm gonna get out of here,

467
00:24:51,963 --> 00:24:53,332
grab a little vino,
maybe some...

468
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:55,470
- Just let me fix your hair.
- Ow, ow, Jemma!

469
00:24:58,308 --> 00:24:59,778
I'm bleeding.

470
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,482
Did you get
my birthday present, Roy?

471
00:25:01,514 --> 00:25:02,884
What are you doing here?

472
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,889
- You're acting so weird.
- Did you get it, the present?

473
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,392
- I sent it to you.
- I don't know.

474
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:07,927
- I haven't checked.
- Well, please do.

475
00:25:07,961 --> 00:25:10,033
I sent it a few days ago.

476
00:25:10,832 --> 00:25:12,469
I will. Of course I will.

477
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:16,077
VENTOR ON SPEAKERS: <i>Dr Wells,
could I see you for a moment?</i>

478
00:25:17,747 --> 00:25:19,351
ROY: I'm going
to the hospital first.

479
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,822
JEMMA: Be there
in a moment, Colonel.

480
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,392
You drew blood.

481
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:24,660
Listen to me now, Roy.

482
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:28,034
OK, look, I know we haven't
seen much of each other lately,

483
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,005
and I know we've gone down
very different paths.

484
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:31,341
I know, but when I was...

485
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:32,810
It's important you listen!
Just listen!

486
00:25:32,843 --> 00:25:34,213
Alright, you talk,
you talk, you talk.

487
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:36,987
OK. I've forgotten
how trying this can be.

488
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:43,498
OK. Now, I see a lot
of you in Joe. I do.

489
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:45,001
His determination,

490
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:47,040
his willingness to succeed
no matter what.

491
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:48,641
He has some of
your best qualities.

492
00:25:48,675 --> 00:25:49,778
He does.

493
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:52,217
But he also has your selfishness

494
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:55,056
and your ability to just
disappear when it suits...

495
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:57,060
Just when I thought
we were turning a corner.

496
00:25:57,092 --> 00:25:58,528
- ..and run from responsibility.
- OK, alright.

497
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:01,535
What do you want from me?
Just tell me, just tell me.

498
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:05,710
I want the man I fell
in love with a long time ago,

499
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:08,114
the one who gave me a son,

500
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,686
the strong, confident
version of you,

501
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:13,591
not the Roy who's out
every night getting hammered

502
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:15,530
and banging a different bimbo.

503
00:26:15,562 --> 00:26:17,299
[door opens]

504
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:29,591
[whispers]
Remember this - Osiris.

505
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:32,297
- Osiris.
- OK.

506
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:44,454
[door opens, closes]

507
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:47,593
Whoa.

508
00:26:47,627 --> 00:26:50,433
Look. It's Roid and Rage.

509
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:55,709
You know, carbohydrates
are not your friend, fellas.

510
00:26:55,743 --> 00:26:58,984
[low ominous music]

511
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,690
VENTOR: Dr Wells, are you well?

512
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,761
Yes.

513
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:06,398
VENTOR:
Does cigar smoke bother you?

514
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,368
No, not at all.

515
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:18,322
The Spindle.

516
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,465
Well, we're experiencing
a minor delay at the moment.

517
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,340
Define 'minor'.

518
00:27:27,372 --> 00:27:30,578
A week, two weeks at the most.

519
00:27:30,612 --> 00:27:32,684
And why?

520
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,490
R&D is never an exact science.

521
00:27:37,192 --> 00:27:41,068
And yet that's exactly what
we're after - exact science.

522
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,877
Your, uh, friend,
Captain Pulver.

523
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,281
JEMMA: Yes,
he dropped off a résumé.

524
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,185
And whatever possessed him?

525
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:53,058
Well, I may have mentioned,
in passing,

526
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,763
the military presence
here at the lab.

527
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:57,499
And whatever possessed you?

528
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,207
The security protocols
of this facility

529
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:03,779
should not be
the subject of pillow talk.

530
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:06,250
I can assure you they're not.

531
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,020
Roy and I are not in...

532
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,758
You are the mother
of his child, no?

533
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:14,534
[Ventor laughs] Huh.

534
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:18,342
Please, please, sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

535
00:28:18,374 --> 00:28:22,617
I don't want this to seem
like an interrogation.

536
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:31,167
I'm not one for long stories.

537
00:28:31,201 --> 00:28:33,940
I'm someone who's always
appreciated brevity in any form.

538
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:35,476
The shorter, the better.

539
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:40,351
However, I do have one story
that I've told and retold,

540
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,192
and it's a story that I would
like to share with you now,

541
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:44,862
if you'll indulge me.

542
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:47,967
Oh. I happen to like
long stories.

543
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,105
Well, good.
Then we're both in luck.

544
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:54,147
So, Burma 1979.

545
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,550
I was doing skunk work
for the CIA,

546
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,588
smuggling enough opium
into the country

547
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:00,994
to backstop
a very bloody military coup

548
00:29:01,026 --> 00:29:03,164
that we would eventually
stage a decade later.

549
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:05,736
This is all
mostly declassified, mostly.

550
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:11,547
At any rate, I find myself
in the jungle outside Rangoon,

551
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:14,855
sniping soldiers
from the KNU Liberation Front

552
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,925
in a three-day running firefight

553
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,598
that had cost me my entire team.

554
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,404
So there I am,
on the verge of being overrun

555
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:26,244
by a bunch of
machete-wielding rebels

556
00:29:26,277 --> 00:29:28,749
who have terrible attitudes
and even worse hygiene,

557
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:32,289
and all I have is a Remington
Buckmaster with a shot-out scope

558
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:35,931
and 36 sleepless hours
in which to squeeze out a win.

559
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:37,466
Huh!

560
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,206
And then I hear it.

561
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:45,983
This piercing squeal,

562
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,122
like a steam whistle.

563
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,363
A wild boar.

564
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:55,602
Make you piss your pants.

565
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:59,409
The sound alone was enough
to make the rebels scatter.

566
00:29:59,443 --> 00:30:01,681
No-one wants to
fuck with the tusks.

567
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:04,220
So now this son of a bitch
gets a sniff of me

568
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:05,857
and comes at me straightaway.

569
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:09,630
Now, I'd rather put a bullet
in 10 men than kill an animal,

570
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:13,237
but before I'm even presented
with the do-or-die of it all,

571
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,913
an 18-foot Burmese python
comes down from a banyan tree

572
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:22,222
and wraps up this raging hog
like a Christmas ham.

573
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,794
Huh! I've never seen
anything like it.

574
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:28,235
And for the next few hours,
I watch in wonder

575
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:32,309
as this snake slowly suffocates
and devours this pig.

576
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:35,848
It was oddly quiet
so I could hear everything,

577
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,419
the boar's bones snapping,

578
00:30:37,453 --> 00:30:40,192
the bellows-like wheeze
as its lungs collapsed

579
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:43,097
that made it sound like
the snake was laughing.

580
00:30:43,131 --> 00:30:45,135
[chuckles]

581
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:49,343
It remains the most
awe-inspiring

582
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,215
act of violence
I have ever seen.

583
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:54,654
But what struck me most,

584
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,359
even as the python
extended its jaws

585
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:00,565
a full two feet
to devour its prey...

586
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,477
..was the calm
and calculation in its eyes.

587
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,785
And it wasn't till later

588
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,755
when it finally moved
its midsection,

589
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,829
now distended with
the outline of that boar,

590
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:17,799
that I saw a dozen eggs.

591
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:19,671
Python eggs.

592
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:24,379
That boar was about
to trample its nest.

593
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:28,188
So what I had first perceived
as an act of aggression

594
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,625
was actually an act of love.

595
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:35,369
The snake killing the boar
not out of malice,

596
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:37,739
but out of necessity

597
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:41,181
to prevent its future
from being obliterated.

598
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:42,849
Hmm.

599
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:48,827
I enjoyed that story.

600
00:31:48,862 --> 00:31:52,803
Oh, and I enjoy telling it.
I also thought it apt.

601
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,507
How so?

602
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,511
No more visitors to the lab.

603
00:31:56,544 --> 00:31:59,016
No ex-boyfriends, old flames,

604
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:01,588
or shadowy figures
from the past.

605
00:32:02,956 --> 00:32:04,894
If there's a delay in the work,

606
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:08,268
I want to be apprised
of it posthaste, yes?

607
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,472
Of course.

608
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:13,444
Thank you, Doctor.
That's wonderful.

609
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,510
VENTOR: Do watch your step.

610
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:44,607
[upbeat funky music]

611
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,710
- [laughter]
- ROY: You want another one?

612
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:49,183
WOMAN: Mm, another one of what?

613
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:50,785
Hey?

614
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,389
[laughing]

615
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:53,657
[woman purrs]

616
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,896
[Roy laughs] You are sweet.

617
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,665
[laughter continues]

618
00:32:57,699 --> 00:33:00,806
So how long have you two
known each other?

619
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,311
Oh, we only met today.

620
00:33:03,343 --> 00:33:05,315
He is my newest best friend.

621
00:33:05,347 --> 00:33:06,650
Yes, I am.

622
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:08,687
Alice is a dental hygienist.

623
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:13,031
Which is weird
'cause I totally hate teeth.

624
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:15,568
I mean, just the texture of them
grosses me out.

625
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,773
Then a career
in dentistry seems...

626
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:20,112
Like the last thing
I should be doing?

627
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,547
Yeah, I know, I know.

628
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,855
But, you know, I'm...
I'm all about a challenge.

629
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:29,429
I like to, like, push myself
out of my comfort zone.

630
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:32,035
It's the only way
to grow, really.

631
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,239
ALICE: So true.

632
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,411
So pretty. Isn't he pretty?

633
00:33:36,443 --> 00:33:38,514
- [Roy chuckles]
- ALICE: Mmm.

634
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:40,919
How long have you guys
known each other?

635
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,689
ROY: Oh, Gabrielle?

636
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,361
For as long as I've been
drinking in this bar.

637
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:48,067
Since he got back from overseas.

638
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:50,572
ALICE: Oh, danger! Do tell.

639
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:53,677
Oh, ladies, there's really
almost nothing to tell.

640
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,216
Then tell us almost nothing.

641
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,521
ALICE: Mm! But can you wait?

642
00:33:58,553 --> 00:34:01,259
'Cause... I gotta pee.

643
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:04,099
Oh, my God. Hold that.
I'll be right back.

644
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:06,538
[Alice giggles]

645
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:11,147
You should take her home, Roy.

646
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,051
[laughs]

647
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,988
You should take her home.

648
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:19,396
[Roy chuckles]

649
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:21,901
You're about to ask,

650
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:24,740
"Why not take you home too,
Gabrielle?"

651
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,045
And I'll say...

652
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,889
.. "Maybe another night."

653
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:33,658
[Roy sighs]

654
00:34:33,691 --> 00:34:36,063
I'm starting to wear you down.

655
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:38,534
[speaking French]

656
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:45,447
We'd have fun, Roy,
but we'll never be in love.

657
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,752
ROY: Oh, love!

658
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,356
- No.
- Why?

659
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,026
- Why?
- Yeah.

660
00:34:52,094 --> 00:34:54,199
Because you're still in love...

661
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,706
..with someone else.

662
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,612
It's in your eyes.

663
00:35:02,048 --> 00:35:04,620
In the sadness I see there.

664
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:11,634
There is a woman you long for,
but it's not me.

665
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:17,111
And it's not
our lovely hygienist.

666
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:21,653
[phone ringing]

667
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:27,533
Bar, hello. Yeah.

668
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:29,803
It's for you.

669
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:32,074
ROY: <i>Who the hell's
calling me now?</i>

670
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:34,146
GABRIELLE: <i>I don't know.</i>

671
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:35,415
ROY: <i>Hello?</i>

672
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:37,319
Roy, can you hear me?

673
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:39,556
Jemma? What...

674
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:42,229
<i>Are you still at the lab?
It's almost 3 am.</i>

675
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:44,099
Jemma, you OK?

676
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:46,137
- <i>You alright?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine, but...

677
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:47,638
<i>What's going on? Listen...</i>

678
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:49,710
Yeah, listen to me.

679
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,748
I think I might have
to do something drastic,

680
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:54,253
<i>and if anything happens,</i>

681
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,190
<i>promise me
you'll do what you do...</i>

682
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:58,094
[static, voice cutting out]

683
00:35:58,127 --> 00:35:59,730
I can't... I can't hear you.

684
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:01,467
JEMMA: <i>I'm gonna need your help.</i>

685
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,438
ROY: <i>Wait, wait.
What's going on? Are you OK?</i>

686
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:04,840
JEMMA: <i>I can't explain
it right now.</i>

687
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:06,443
<i>But you wouldn't
understand anyway.</i>

688
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:08,547
[line beeping]

689
00:36:09,683 --> 00:36:11,821
Hey, I think I lost you.

690
00:36:12,688 --> 00:36:14,960
Jemma, call me back, OK?

691
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:18,600
Who was that?

692
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,173
It was my ex and she was...

693
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:23,211
She sounded pretty worked up.

694
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,159
[door opens and shuts]

695
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:35,534
It seems our dear doctor
has gone rogue.

696
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:39,110
Find her.

697
00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:45,087

Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

No, I was just telling Chef Jake
about this loudmouth...

917
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:09,340
Got it, great. Dave, you know
anything about tracking devices?

918
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:12,346
I don't know anything about
that kind of thing, Roy.

919

I know <i>everything</i>

A body-based

923
00:49:20,897 --> 00:49:22,901
What's better
if you don't want the person

924
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:24,071
to know they're being tracked?

925
00:49:24,103 --> 00:49:26,575
Well, an implantable version
is loads more reliable.

926
00:49:26,607 --> 00:49:28,345
A body-based device
would be attached to clothing...

927

Where would you do it?

Yeah, yeah.

The teeth, Roy. The teeth!

Would you be able
to look at a tooth

946
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,909
and detect if there was
a tracking device in it?

947

I mean, not while it's
inside someone's mouth.

948
00:50:18,914 --> 00:50:21,118

I could possibly check it out.
