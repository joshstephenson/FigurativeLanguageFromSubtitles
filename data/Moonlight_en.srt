00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,510
Hey, my man, T., what's going on, dawg?

2
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,860
- What's up, what's up.
- ...How you doing?

3
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,570
- What you need?
- Can you help me out, man?

4
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,440
No, I can't do it, bro. You gotta keep it moving, bro.

5
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,990
- I can't do it right now, bro.
- Come on, man. What you talking about.

6
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,490
Police out here, man. Keep it moving, bro.

7
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,610
- Ey, boy.
- Step to the side, man.

8
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,200
- How you doing?
- What's good with you?

9
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,370
I'm all right, man. I'm out here, handling business as usual.

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,370
Look, man, I don't mean no disrespect or nothing to you,

11
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,660
I'm just trying to see if I can get a little...

12
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,960
You can't get nothing, man. You know what time it is, bruh?

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,420
I keep looking out for you, man.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,670
Just a little something, man?

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,500
All my something cost a little something, man.

16
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,840
If he ain't got it, get to stepping, nigga.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,420
You know what time it is? I don't feel like repeating myself.

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,420
Hey, you know you my man, right, Juan?

19
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,010

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,350
See... see... see... see if you can do something here for me...

21
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,160

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,270
Let me get this shit! Nigga, get the fuck out of here, man. Go on!

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,650
Oh, get that nigga, man.

00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,150

00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,270
- Yo, I'm just out here, you know.

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,910
Regular day. You know... you know...

27
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,450
It's in the cut. Everything cleaned out if you need anything.

28
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,240
- Business good?
- Yeah, it's good.

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,120
- I got something for you...
- No, no, no. Hold onto that.

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,360
- Okay, all right.
- Empty the register on the weekend.

31
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,700
All right, no problem, son.

32
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,040
How your mom feeling now?

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,950
Oh, she doing good. She doing excellent.

She's in my prayers, man.

36
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,220
Most naturally. Thank you.

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,550
Thanks for the opportunity. I'm out here.

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,310
- Get him!
- Get your ass right here.

39
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,640
- Get him!
- Why you always running?

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,930
Going around with that faggot ass, bro!

41
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,320
- Ain't gonna catch him!

42
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,900
- Catch his ass!
- Run, then, nigga!

43
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,240
- Come on, bro. Get his gay ass!
- Catch that faggot ass nigga.

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,240
Come on, bro! Catch that nigga! Catch that nigga!

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,480
What you doing in here, little man?

47
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,520
You don't talk to strangers?

48
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,690
Alight. It's cool.

49
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,440

50
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,870
Listen...

51
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,550
I'm about to go get something to eat.

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,040
You're welcome to join me if you want.

53
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,220
It's okay if I take the front door?

54
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,170
Come on now.

55
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,950
Can't be no worse out here.

56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,810
You not gonna tell me what yo' name is? Hmm?

57
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,400
How about where you live?

58
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,610
I gotta get you home, I'll man.

59
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,950
Can't have you just running around these dope holes.

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,370
You understand?

61
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,350
Hey, hey, hey, hey, my bad.

62
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,220
Oh, man, you know I ain't gonna do you like that.

63
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,640
Hey, man, I apologize, all right?

64
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,190
I'm just trying to get you to say something.

65
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,990
I apologize.

66
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,580
All right.

67
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,240
All right.

68
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,920
You all right now...

69
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,920
until my girl come get you, though.

70
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,760
She go make you talk.

71
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,430
I'll be right back.

72
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,560
- Teresa!
- Hey, baby.

73
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,890
- I found this little boy in a dope spot.
- Found a little boy in a what?

74
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,020
Wasn't no crackheads up in there. He by himself.

75
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,820
He ain't talking though, so why don't you see if you can get him to say something?

76
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,110
Really?

77
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,120
Just go talk to him. Just go talk to him.

78
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,290
I cannot believe you.

79
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,580
- Love you.
- Why would you do something like this?

80
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,450
You don't talk much, but you damn sure can eat.

81
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,090
That's all right, baby.

82
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,510
You ain't got to talk 'til you get good and ready.

83
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
My name is Chiron.

84
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,800
People call me little.

85
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,360
All right then, little.

86
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,020
Well, Imma call you by your name, then.

87
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,030
Where you from, Chiron?

88
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,990
Liberty City.

89
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,040
You live with your mama?

90
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,820
Yes.

91
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,500
What about your daddy?

92
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,450
That's all right.

93
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,050
You want us to take you home, then,

94
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,040
after you get finished eating your food?

95
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,420
Yeah, you gotta tell us where you live, bruh.

96
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,260
No...

97
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,850
Okay.

98
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,070
You can stay here tonight.

99
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,610
Teresa...

100
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,660
Would you like that?

101
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,690
Okay.

102
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,000
What happened?

103
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,120
What happened, Chiron?

104
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,090
Why you didn't come home like you supposed to? Huh?

105
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,460
And who is you?

106
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,140
Nobody.

107
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,850
I found him yesterday. Found him in a hole on 15th.

108
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,060
Yeah. That one.

109
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,770
Some boys chased him in the cut. He's scared more than anything.

110
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,980
He wouldn't tell me where he lived 'til this morning.

111
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,820
Well, thanks for seeing to him.

112
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,320
He usually can take care of hisself.

113
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,240
He good that way, but...

114
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,790
Little man.

115
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,930
You a real damn prize, Chiron. You know that?

116
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,440
You got'sta come home when you meant to come home.

117
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,900
You hear?

118
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,830
That's all right, baby.

119
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
That's all right.

120
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:48,580
Mama just glad you're home.

121
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,300
Nuh-uh.

122
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,930
TV privileges revoked.

123
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,430
Find something for you to read.

124
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,570
- Where the ball at?
- I don't got the ball no more!

125
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,760
Hey, Little!

126
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,140
Wassup, man?

127
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,110
Hey, Kevin.

128
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,150
Why'd you leave?

129
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,650
I don't know.

130
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,080
Yeah, it get boring after a while.

131
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,120
What? It's bleeding?

132
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,510
- What?
- You funny, man.

133
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,430
Why you say that?

134
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,390
Just is, that's all.

135
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,530
Why do you always let people pick on you, man?

136
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,190
What you mean?

137
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,310
You always letting them pick on you.

138
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,690
So? What I gotta do?

139
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,120
All you gotta do is show these niggas you ain't soft.

140
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,120
- But I ain't soft.
- I know, I know.

141
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,740
But it don't mean nothing if they don't know.

142
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,450
Come on. You want these fools to pick on you every day?

143
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,080
See, Little?

144
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,970
I knew you wasn't soft.

145
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,040
Come on, man.

146
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,900
Give me your head.

147
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,570
Here, let your head rest in my hand. Relax.

148
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,120
I got you, I promise. I'm not gon' let you go.

149
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,250
Hey, man, I got you.

150
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,290
There you go. Ten seconds.

151
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,140
Feel that right there?

152
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,930
You're in the middle of the world, man.

153
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,390
That's good.

154
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,150
Do like this.

155
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,280
Look at you.

156
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,900
More athletic.

157
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,150
There you go... there you go.

158
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,910
Yeah. I think you ready.

159
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,660
I think we got a swimmer.

160
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,700
You wanna try? You ready to swim?

161
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,550
Go.

162
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,250
Yeah, man!

163
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,800
Yeah!

164
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,450
Let me tell you something, man.

165
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,490
There are black people everywhere.

166
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,290
Remember that, okay?

167
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,290
No place you can go in the world ain't got no black people.

168
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,250
We's the first on this planet.

169
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,130
I been here a long time.

170
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,220
But I'm from Cuba.

171
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,840
Lot of black folks in Cuba,

172
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,770
you wouldn't know that from being here, though.

173
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,520
I was a wild little shorty, man, just like you.

174
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,060
Running around with no shoes on when the moon was out.

175
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,570
This one time...

176
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,280
I run by this old... this old lady.

177
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,460
I was running, hollerin'... cutting a fool, boy.

178
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,620
This old lady, she stopped me.

179
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,050
She said...

180
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,680
"Running around, catching up all that light.

181
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,520
In moonlight... black boys look blue.

182
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,440
You blue.

183
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,310
That's what I gon' call you.

184
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,060
Blue."

185
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,160
So your name Blue?

186
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,070
Nah.

187
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,630
At some point you gotta decide for yourself who you gon' be.

188
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,710
Can't let nobody make that decision for you.

189
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,430
How you like swimming, man?

190
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,610
That much, huh?

191
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,480
Hey, hold up, hold up.

192
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,780
Pick one.

193
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,790
Ha, ha. Good choice.

194
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,300
Put it in your pocket.

195
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,150
Yo, hold up. Whoa, whoa, hey...

196
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,870
Come on.

197
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,200
What's going on, Little Man?

198
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,790
Come on!

199
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,900
Man, y'alls the same as mine.

200
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,730
At least mine don't look like Freddy Krueger.

201
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,770
Yours ugly as hell.

202
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,200
Mine don't look like no peanut.

203
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,700
Telling you, mine does not look like no peanut.

204
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,280
Who let his ass in?

205
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:47,990
Somebody with you?

206
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,370
Man, I swear it was locked.

207
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,200
Man, ain't no foul! Ain't no foul!

208
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,490
- S'up?!
- Come on, man!

209
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,450
You're dead, baby! Right in your face!

210
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,190
It's what I paid for. It ain't what I bought.

211
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,030
Man, that's Grade A quality. What else you want me to do?

212
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,370
Nigga, this shit look more like Grade C.

213
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,790
Man, look. I ain't going with that, man!

214
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,380
- I want my money back.
- What?! Ain't no refund, man.

215
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,670
Just stuff it, man. Keep movin'. Come on.

216
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,750
Yo, what's up? All right.

217
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,470
Thought you was on vacation or some shit.

218
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,880
Come on, man, no vacation out here. I know the work, you know that.

219
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,720
Going to Switzerland or some shit.

220
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,100
Switzerland, man.

221
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,560
Maybe Brazil, you know, with two bad bitches.

222
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,940
How Peanut working out?

223
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,850

224
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940

- Good, man.

225
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,070

226
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,740
Hell no, you know I ain't gonna let that go down.

227
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,790
Yo, nigga, you letting people light up at the spot, now?

228
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,910

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,460
Come on, you know I ain't gonna let that happen, man.

230
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,180
What the fuck, man?

231
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,190
Yo, nigga, what's up?

232
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,520
Hey, hey, hey, it's all good, man.

233
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,780
- Fuck you doing?
- It's all good, Juan.

234
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,530

235
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,500
- It's all good...
- Get out the fucking car!

236
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,830
- Calm down, man.
- You shut the fuck up.

237
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,330
What's wrong with you?

238
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,870
Who the hell you think you is? Huh?

239
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,840
Bitch, get the fuck out of here.

240
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,560
What, so you gon' raise my son now? Huh?

241
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,050
You gon' raise my son?

242
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,560
- Yeah... that's what I thought.
- You gon' raise him?!

243
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,120
You gon' keep selling me rocks? Huh?

244
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,880
Motherfucker.

245
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,640
Don't give me that "You gotta get it from somewhere" shit, nigga.

246
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,530
I'm getting it from you.

247
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,190
But you gon' raise my son, though, right?

248
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,320
- You ever see the way he walk, Juan?
- You watch your damn mouth.

249
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,130
You gon' tell him why the other boys kick his ass all the time? Huh?

250
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,000
You gon' tell him?

251
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,290
You ain't shit.

252
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,560
Come on! Let's go!

253
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,660
The fuck y'all looking at?

254
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:13,900
Hey, Teresa. Your boyfriend's here.

255
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,280
Boy.

256
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,000
You talking to me today?

257
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,700
Okay. That's all right.

258
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,410
I don't wanna talk to you, anyway.

259
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
You know she got a crush on you, right?

260
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,730
You all right?

261
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,470
You walk all the way here?

262
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,280
All right.

263
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,330
First things first. You can't sit at my table like that.

264
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,330
You can't sit with your back to the door, come on.

265
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,710
How you gon' know if somebody creeping up on you.

266
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,290
All right, see that?

267
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,200
Now you can see everything.

268
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,070
What's over there?

269
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,440
Saw your mom last night.

270
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,120
I hate her.

271
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,420
Yeah, I bet you do.

272
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,470
I hated my mom, too.

273
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,880
I miss her like hell now, though.

274
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,590
That's all I'm gon' say about that.

275
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,450
Thank you.

276
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,700
What's a faggot?

277
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,100
A faggot is...

278
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,310
a word used to make gay people feel bad.

279
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,850
- Am I a faggot?
- No.

280
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,230
No.

281
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,120
You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody call you no faggot.

282
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,700
I mean, unless...

283
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,210
How do I know?

284
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,380
You just do.

285
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,970
I think.

286
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,130
You'll know when you know.

287
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,490
You ain't gotta know right now, all right?

288
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,020
Not yet.

289
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,920
Do you sell drugs?

290
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,720
Yeah.

291
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,610
And my mama...

292
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,350
She do drugs, right?

293
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,120
Yeah.

294
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,000
Okay, deoxyribonucleic acid.

295
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,710
Long word, right? All right, it's basically genes.

296
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,710
I know y'all don't know what that means, but just hang with me for a second.

297
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,000
So it's basically this long...

298
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,550
Chiron, you need something?

299
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,040
Hey, yo, that nigga forgot to change his tampon.

300
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,550
I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce. He just having woman problems today.

301
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Ain't that right, Little?

302
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,270
All right, Terrel, that's enough.

303
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,770
Nah, can't be enough for Little.

304
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,970
- How much you need, Little?
- Don't call me that!

305
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,230
All right, Terrel, that's it.

306
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,560
Hey, what you gonna do, Chiron? I fuck you up.

307
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,570
Hey, yo, Terrel! Out!

308
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,940
Come on, man. What's wrong with you?

309
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:04,510
Where were we? So DNA, it's basically this long molecule...

310
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,150
Imma be waiting for your ass, Little.

311
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,030
Come on, Chiron.

312
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,880
Chiron, what's up, man?

313
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,300
Damn, nigga. You straight spaced, dawg.

314
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,510
Yo, school been out. You ain't going home?

315
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,550
- Uh... What you doing here?
- Detention, man.

316
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,730
Aimes caught me with this trick in the stairway.

317
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,600
- Damn.
- Yeah.

318
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,760
- With who?
- Damn, you nosey, nigga.

319
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,110
- My bad...
- No, I'm playing, yo.

320
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,980
Look, I wanted some quick head, you know,

321
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,060
but this chick all like, "Hit that shit, Kevin. Hit it with that big dick."

322
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,270
Why she got to compliment a nigga for?

323
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,320
So I'm like, "A'ight, like, shit, we can do this", you know?

324
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,950
So I started banging her back out, dawg.

325
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,740
I'm talking I'm banging her back out.

326
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,880
She went and made all this fucking noise, though.

327
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,750
So Aimes come in, acting like 5-0 and shit, almost had my ass suspended, dawg.

328
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,090
I talked it out, though, you know.

329
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,260
I told him we was like childhood sweethearts and all of that,

330
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,220
so I just got detention. It's cool.

331
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,850
- Cool.
- That stay between us, a'ight?

332
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,730
- Yeah.
- I know you can keep a secret, dawg.

333
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,940
Real talk though, I gotta go, a'ight? Before this fool change his mind.

334
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,400
All right, Kev.

335
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,850
See you, Black.

336
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,070
- Hey, Mama.
- Uh-uh. You cannot be here tonight.

337
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,400
I got company coming.

338
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,910
Find somewhere for you to be.

339
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,170
Find somewhere for you to be.

340
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,880
All right.

341
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,340
Water for me... and a little gin for you.

342
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,980
Boy, please.

343
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,850
I know Juan used to give you that gin.

344
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,180
But we ain't doing that up in here, shorty.

345
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,780
You don't think my joke was funny?

346
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,450
What's wrong?

347
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,500
Nothing. I'm good.

348
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,960
No. I've seen good and you ain't it.

349
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,130
Stop putting your head down in my house. You know my rule.

350
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:39,380
It's all love and all pride in this house.

351
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,930
You feel me?

352
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,220
I can't hear you.

353
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,550
- Do you feel me?
- Yeah.

354
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,390
- Okay.
- I feel you.

355
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,980
All right.

356
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,280
Thank you for this.

357
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,040
Boy, please, you know you can stay here any time you need to.

358
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,920
Okay? Any time.

359
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,500
Yeah.

360
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,870
Thank you, Teresa. I mean it.

361
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,170
Now, if you gon' stay here, though,

362
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,850
you gonna have to learn how to make a bed better than this, boy.

363
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,430
- What?
- What you mean, "What"?

364
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,680
Give me that. That ain't how you make up no bed.

365
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,930
You think you slick, too.

366
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,440
You know, do it all wrong so Teresa can come over here and do it right.

367
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,520
I know what you doing. Oof, you and Juan.

368
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,450
Y'all two, thick as thieves. Give me that.

369
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,930
All right.

370
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,850
Do you need anything else from me, sweetheart?

371
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:12,430
- Uh, no, I'm good.
- Okay.

372
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,390
All right, I'm gonna wake you up in the morning.

373
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,960
You good, Black?

374
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,060
Chiron!

375
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,220
- Hey! Hey, baby!
- Hey, Mama.

376
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,520
- Where'd you go last night?
- What?

377
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Why?

378
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,490
Well, I'm yo' mama, ain't I?

379
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Why you ain't just come home later, boy?

380
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,250
You had me worried about you.

381
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,950
I guess you getting grown.

382
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:02,080
I can't be keeping up with you all the time.

383
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,920
Anyway, baby, how Teresa doing?

384
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,430
I ain't seen her since the funeral.

385
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,260
Listen, Mama locked herself out the door, yeah?

386
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,850
Can you come let her in?

387
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,560
Come on, baby.

388
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:24,950
Let me in, baby.

389
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,820
Baby, come on.

390
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,530
I thought you said...

391
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,990
Mama, I thought you...

392
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,920
Wait, Mama... Mama!

393
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,400
I need some money.

394
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,020
For what?

395
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,850
That's my business. Don't you ask me no shit like that.

396
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,240
- I don't have no money...
- No, no. Don't lie to me, boy.

397
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,690
I'm your mama. That bitch over there ain't no kin of you.

398
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,820
I'm your blood, remember?

399
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,420
Now I ain't feeling good.

400
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
I need something to help me out.

401
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,080
Come on, baby.

402
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,370
Come on, baby.

403
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,010
Where am I supposed to get money from?

404
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,430
What?

405
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:34,890
Teresa ain't give you nothing, huh?

406
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,300
Your little play-play mama ain't put something in your hand?

407
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,520
Give me that damn money, Chiron.

408
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,270
Give me the damn money! Give me the damn money!

409
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,440
I don't have no money!

410
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,200
- Mama, come on...
- Give me the damn money!

411
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,700
- Mama, come on...
- Give me the damn money!

412
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,620
All right! All right!

413
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,080
Give me the damn money.

414
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:57,950
Here, man.

415
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,950
Yes. That is what I thought.

416
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,750
I know that bitch like a hooker know her trick.

417
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,370
You my child, okay?

418
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,460
And tell that bitch she better not forget it.

419
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:11,180
Go on to school.

420
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,460
Ain't you late?

421
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,060
So you can see how a lack of white blood cells

422
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,900
can be dangerous to the human body, right?

423
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,830
Okay, can anyone explain what will happen to the body

424
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,040
if there's not enough white blood cells?

425
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,910
Ain't nobody's leaving this classroom until I get a response.

426
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,460
This is more important for you than it is for me, trust me.

427
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,460
- Hey, yo, Little!
- Fuck.

428
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,720
Where you going to so fast, huh?

429
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,130
I'm going home.

430
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,890
Man, I told you. I'm going home!

431
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:04,430
You think we stupid? You live over there, nigga.

432
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,400
Oh, no, he going to Teresa house.

433
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,280
Teresa? That's Juan lady, ain't it?

434
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,690
Oh, yeah. She fine as hell.

435
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,770
- Juan been dead a minute, though.
- You right.

436
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,120
Hell, she give free head? Or does she charge like Paula?

437
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,660
Hell, Paula getting cheap, though.

438
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,250
Talking like a rock can get your rock sucked!

439
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,960
- Nigga, what was that?!
- Yo, what you doing, man?

440
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,290
Get off me, dawg.

441
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,950
Now I ain't with that gay shit,

442
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,670
but if you fuck with me, I'll give your ass more than you can handle,

443
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,540
have you running to your crackhead-ass mama.

444
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,880
My nigga!

445
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,670
- Fuck y'all niggas!
- What'd you say?! Huh?

446
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,930
Say that shit again, dog, I swear.

447
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,010
Whatever, man.

448
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,440
Alright, you better stay your ass right there if you know what's good for you.

449
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,400
Yo, why your jeans so tight?

450
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,070
Yo, Pizzo, you see these nigga's jeans be?

451
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,030
- I see them shits.
- Nigga nuts must be chokin'

452
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,400
in those shits, boy, I swear!

453
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,820
- Real talk!
- A'ight, night, Little.

454
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,190
See your ass later.

455
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,420
Metrorail closing in 15 minutes.

456
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,460
You was waiting for me?

457
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,300
Well, nice to see you too.

458
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,850
What you doing out here, man?

459
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,520
Nigga, what you doing out here?

460
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,020
This is my smoker habitat, nigga.

461
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:00,480
Oh, what, you smoke out here too?

462
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,780
Something like that.

463
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,610
Tsk... nah, you don't smoke.

464
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,150
Why you pretending?

465
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,700
Trying to put on a show for me, Black?

466
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,760
Why you always calling me that?

467
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,580
- What, Black?
- Yeah, Black.

468
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,790
That's my nickname for you. You don't like it?

469
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,260
No, it's just...

470
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,470
What kind of dude goes around giving other dudes nicknames?

471
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,140
The kind of dude what just sat down

472
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,690
and is about to put you onto this blunt, nigga.

473
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:39,110
Yeah. You like the water?

474
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:41,350
Well, I can introduce you to some "fiyah."

475
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,100
Tsk, come on, nigga. It ain't gonna bite you.

476
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,950
Oh, man...

477
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,700
Damn, I didn't know you smoked like that.

478
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,630
My moms leaves all types of shit around.

479
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,650
That breeze feel good as hell man.

480
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,910
Yeah, it do.

481
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:14,620
Sometimes round the way, where we live, you can catch that same breeze.

482
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,200
It just come through the hood

483
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,380
and it's like everything stop for a second...

484
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,050
'cause everyone just wanna feel it.

485
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,340
Everything just gets quiet, you know?

486
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,260
And it's like all you can hear is your own heartbeat.

487
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,630
Right?

488
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,770
Yeah...

489
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,260
Feel so good, man.

490
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:40,890
So good...

491
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,940
Hell, shit make you wanna cry, feel so good.

492
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,660
You cry?

493
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,650
Nah.

494
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,240
Makes me want to.

495
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:03,000
What you cry about?

496
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:11,340
Shit, I cry so much, sometimes I feel like Imma just turn into drops.

497
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,390
You just roll out into the water, right?

498
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,730
Roll out into the water like all these other motherfuckers around here

499
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,390
trying to drown they sorrows.

500
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,110
Why you say that?

501
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,070
I'm just listening to you, nigga.

502
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:35,190
Sound like something you wanna do.

503
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,290
I wanna do a lot of things that don't make sense.

504
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,880
I didn't say it don't make sense.

505
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:54,310
But tell me, like... like what?

506
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,140
Like what "lot of things"?

507
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:01,730
Damn, dog! You nosey.

508
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,070
Chiron cursing now, huh?

509
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,780
- You trying to get smart with me?
- Whatever, man.

510
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,360
Nah, you trying to get smart with me, huh, Chiron?

511
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,070
Yeah, you trying to get smart with me, huh?

512
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,270
I'm sorry...

513
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,190
What you gotta be sorry for?

514
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,880
You ain't never done nothing like that before, huh?

515
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,100
Thanks for the ride, man.

516
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,100
No problem, Black.

517
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:52,490
I'll see you around.

518
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,360
Yeah...

519
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,650
See you around.

520
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,040
Come here, baby.

521
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:58,080
Come here.

522
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,340
You don't love me no more...

523
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:09,350
You don't love me no more...

524
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,480
You're my only.

525
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:18,020
I'm your only.

526
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,530
You're my only...

527
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:48,560
- Yo, what's up, Kev?
- Terrel, what's up man?

528
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,020
Hey, you know a nigga don't see school no more.

529
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,650
Yo, I hear you, man.

530
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,350
Now the lunch used to be the shit, though.

531
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,690
Nah, the food wasn't never good.

532
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,730
Man, I ain't talking about the food.

533
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,870
But that Friday pizza was the shit.

534
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,240
Yeah, I feel you, a'ight.

535
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,320
Nah, but you remember in middle school, that game we used to play?

536
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,380
"Knock down/stay down"?

537
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,290
Yeah, yo, my crazy ass was the king of that shit.

538
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,540
Yeah, I remember. Yo!

539
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,420
You remember that white kid you fucked up?

540
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,250
Cuban cat, right? Mauricio or something?

541
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,970
Oh, yeah! Yo, you fucked that kid's face up!

542
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,810
We was calling you Tyson after that shit.

543
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,850
Yeah.

544
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,600
Yo, but, uh...

545
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,720
niggas don't do that shit no more.

546
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:36,190
I mean... you know...

547
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,110
What you saying?

548
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:44,480
I'm saying is, if I point a nigga out...

549
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,620
is you gonna knock his ass down?

550
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,910
That's the game, ain't it?

551
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,450
You dare me to swing on him and if I do, it's on you.

552
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,130
A'ight. A'ight, Kev.

553
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,170
Let me see who ass getting dropped today.

554
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,710
Don't be drinking none of this gummy juice. Shit'll kill you.

555
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:56,470
Yo, Kev.

556
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:00,940
Hit that nigga.

557
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,850
Hit that nigga, Kev.

558
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,700
Yeah, hit his faggot ass!

559
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,870
- The fuck you waiting on?
- Do it! Come on.

560
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,370
Let's go.

561
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,540
How you like that, Chiron?

562
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,880
Yo, I think he want another one.

563
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,840
- Another one. Do it.
- Give it to him.

564
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,050
- Don't you get up, bruh.
- You stay down!

565
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,680
Yeah, if he get up, knock his faggot ass back down.

566
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,350
- Chiron, stay down!
- He got up.

567
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:43,350
- Come on, man.
- Stay down.

568
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,860
Do it again.

569
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,400
- Do it!
- Do it! Move!

570
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,270
Listen, son...

571
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,600
If you don't press charges,

572
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,740
I can't stop this from happening. Understand?

573
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,360
You don't even know.

574
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,080
Oh, I don't?

575
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,870
You think all this just started, boy?

576
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:42,490
- I ain't no boy.
- The hell you ain't.

577
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,420
If you were a man,

578
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,720
there'd be four other knuckleheads sitting right next to you.

579
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,480
You don't even know.

580
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:02,390
Listen, son, listen.

581
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:03,970
Listen.

582
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,650
I'm not blaming you... I'm not.

583
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,950
I know it's hard.

584
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,570
Believe me.

585
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,000
I'm not trying to disrespect your struggle.

586
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,420
I just need you to know...

587
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,180
All right, all right. Stay focused.

588
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,430
Hey... Hey, Chiron!

589
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,850
Get the fuck off me, nigga!

590
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,240
Get the fuck off me!

591
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:28,510
Don't look at me!

592
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:37,450
- Hello, homie.
- Yo, what's good with you, B?

593
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,670
Vibing, vibing?

594
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:42,920
- What's that?
- You vibing?

595
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:44,970
- I'm trying to.
- Trying to?

596
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,640
So where the hos at?

597
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,430
Nigga, you smiling and shit like you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

598
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,930
Where the hos at, nigga?

599
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,400
I don't know. You tell me.

600
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,060
There's this bitch that stay down the corner.

601
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,850
What's her name?

602
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,780
- Afrodesia.
- You making it up.

603
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,530
I don't believe you.

604
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,160
I ain't never seen you with no bitch, I don't believe you.

605
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:08,160
- Her name Afrodesia.
- Her name Afrodesia? Where she at?

606
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,700
- She only come out at night.
- Okay.

607
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,740
- Yeah.
- Okay.

608
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,120
You short, Travis.

609
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:09,420
- Wait, what?
- Where the rest of the roll?

610
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:10,760
It's all there.

611
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:14,930
I mean, you might could think I'm trouble, when I handed it to you it was all there.

612
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:19,220
It's a'ight. If it's all there, then count that shit then, Trav.

613
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:22,280
Count it, if it's all there.

614
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,330
Move, you're in my spot.

615
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:42,840
Move.

616
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,290
Give me my fucking money, man.

617
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,590
You saying I'm a liar?

618
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,140
All right.

619
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,640
I ain't say that.

620
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,680
I told you to count what's off and you said it wasn't.

621
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,010
That's you calling me a liar.

622
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,940
Nah, all I did was tell you that...

623
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,860
You... you did what?

624
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,040
Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

625
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,160
Count good.

626
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:23,670
Did real good. Here.

627
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,220
Can't be on the corner if you can't take a nigga just fucking with you,

628
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,930
- you feel me?
- Yeah.

629
01:10:58,330 --> 01:11:01,630
Chiron, this your mama.

630
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:06,240
I know it's late, but I...

631
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:10,580
I figured you ain't never been one much for sleep.

632
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,540
Atlanta ain't but so big.

633
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:16,710
It seems to me you come see your mama from time to time.

634
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,760
Hope you getting some rest, baby.

635
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,270
Hope you come by soon.

636
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:47,990
Ma, it's late. I'll be there tomorrow, I promise.

637
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:50,630
Hello?

638
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:56,970
Hey, Black... I mean, uh, Chiron.

639
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,970
What's up, man? This, uh... this Kevin.

640
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:07,600
You there?

641
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,780
Yeah.

642
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,950
Long time, no see, right?

643
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:16,060
Man, I had to ask Teresa for your number, and...

644
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:22,450
Hold up, man. You... you do remember me, right?

645
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:27,950
Yeah, I do.

646
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,500
Been a while.

647
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:34,090
Yeah. Yeah, it has, man.

648
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,420
So, uh, where you at now, man?

649
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,480
Georgia. Atlanta.

650
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:49,810
- I've been up here ever since...
- Yeah. Yeah, man, that's what I heard.

651
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,400
Yeah.

652
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,320
Hey, man, I'm sorry about all that...

653
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:08,460
All that... shit. What went down... Chiron.

654
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:10,500
Real shit, dawg, I am.

655
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,390
So, uh...

656
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:26,140
what you doing up there, man?

657
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,930
Not much. Just...

658
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,270
just trouble.

659
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:35,850
Chiron and trouble always found a way.

660
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,780
Yeah... something like that.

661
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:46,790
- What about you?
- Me?

662
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,620
I'm a cook, man.

663
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:54,580
Y... y... you a cook?

664
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:56,340
Yeah, buddy.

665
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,550
Man, I got sent up for some stupid shit,

666
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:02,170
the same stupid shit we always get sent up for.

667
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:06,310
They put me on the kitchen line, man, and... kinda took to it.

668
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:11,480
Anyway, man, I just... I just thought about you, man, I...

669
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,890
We got this jukebox in here and, uh... folks come by and play they songs,

670
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:17,940
that's the music we get in here, and it's...

671
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:20,900
This dude, man...

672
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,870
Just reminded me of you.

673
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:30,410
So, uh...

674
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:35,250
Hey, man, if you ever come to town, man, you come holla at me.

675
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:37,620
I'll cook you somethin'.

676
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:42,390
Maybe... Maybe play that song for you.

677
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:47,340
All right, man, um... You be easy, all right?

678
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,290
How you been?

679
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:45,380
I'm all right. I ain't sleepin'.

680
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,790
Why not?

681
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,380
- Right. If you knew, you'd...
- Bad dreamin'.

682
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:51,930
Still?

683
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,310
You ever thought about talking about it with somebody?

684
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,560
Maybe not even a counselor, maybe somebody like your mama?

685
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,980
Yeah...

686
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:11,610
Yeah, it sound funny to me too.

687
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:17,170
You talk to Teresa?

688
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:20,620
Yeah.

689
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:22,090
How she doing?

690
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,840
Good.

691
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,470
"Good."

692
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:33,140
When you go home, Ma?

693
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:35,720
Home?

694
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,390
This is home. You know...

695
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,990
I mean, they allowing me to stay and work as long as I like. I figure...

696
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:47,530
Might as well help other folks.

697
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,530
Keep myself out of trouble.

698
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:57,250
- That's good, Mama.
- Yeah.

699
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:02,240
Yeah, I think it is too. I really do.

700
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,380
So, you still in them streets?

701
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:15,760
Didn't come all the way the hell to Georgia

702
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,480
to have you falling in the same shit, Chiron.

703
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,270
- Imma go. Imma go...
- No, no, no, no, you gon' listen!

704
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,640
To who, Ma? Huh?

705
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,490
To you? Really, though?

706
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,110
Please...

707
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:30,650
please.

708
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,340
I messed up.

709
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,840
I fucked it all the way up.

710
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:53,340
I know that.

711
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:58,470
But yo' heart ain't gotta be black like mine, baby.

712
01:19:04,190 --> 01:19:06,400
I love you, Chiron.

713
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:09,780
I do.

714
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,620
I love you, baby.

715
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:18,860
I mean, you ain't gotta love me.

716
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:23,320
Lord knows I did not have love for you when you needed it, I know that.

717
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,120
So you ain't gotta love me.

718
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:31,340
But you gon' know that I love you.

719
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,710
You hear?

720
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,090
You hear me, Chiron?

721
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,800
I hear you, Mama.

722
01:19:57,610 --> 01:19:58,940
Here.

723
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:35,700
I'm sorry, baby.

724
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,440
I'm so sorry.

725
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,090
Come here, Mama.

726
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,380
Be right with you.

727
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,480
How y'all doing?

728
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:03,490
Good? All right. I'll take these.

729
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:06,460
I'll be right back with your check.

730
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,700
Be right with you, boss, just let me get this out the way.

731
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:30,350
All right...

732
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:34,690
All right, man, how you doing tonight?

733
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:36,110
What can I get you...

734
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:39,190
Chiron?

735
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:45,310
Damn man, why you ain't say nothing?

736
01:24:58,290 --> 01:25:00,000
'Sup, Kev?

737
01:25:01,210 --> 01:25:04,670
Damn, man, what... What you doing down here?

738
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,380
I mean...

739
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,760
You here now, man, that's all that matter.

740
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:17,890
There you go with that damn nodding again, man.

741
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,940
You ain't... you ain't changed one damn bit.

742
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:24,810
You still can't say more than three words at a time, huh?

743
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:28,030
Said you was gon' cook for me. I know how to say that.

744
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,490
Yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

745
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,740
Don't look like your ass been missing no meals.

746
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:37,120
Yeah.

747
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,910
But I got you, man. Sit down.

748
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,710
Sit down, man. What you want?

749
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:45,290
You can order off the menu if you want to, or...

750
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:49,220
Hey... I could just hit you with that chef's special.

751
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,260
Yeah.

752
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:01,850
We here, Chiron.

753
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:09,690
One chef's special... coming right up.

754
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:09,710
Chef's special.

755
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:20,260
Oh, so you Cuban now?

756
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:22,230
Only in the kitchen, papi.

757
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:29,190
Yo, sit down, man, or are you gon' eat standing up?

758
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,330
You want a drink?

759
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:38,120
Nah, I don't drink.

760
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:04,230
Nigga, I ain't seen you in like a decade.

761
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:06,230
You gon' drink with me.

762
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:22,000
Nah, bruh, nah, bruh... What you doing, man?

763
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:26,130
Welcome back, bruh.

764
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,020
Damn, brother, I thought you said you didn't drink.

765
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,350
Can't really taste it, so I don't mess with it.

766
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:58,730
- I saw that. I saw that.
- What? What?

767
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:01,120
You don't wanna waste none of that, do you? It tastes good.

768
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,700
Chill out, man. It's straight, bruh.

769
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,030
- Say what?
- It's straight.

770
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,370
"It's straight."

771
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:08,870
Man, please, it's better than Chef Boyardee, ain't it?

772
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,800
Chill out, bruh. My Spaghetti-O's go hard, man.

773
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:17,510
Hey, eat your dinner, man.

774
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:21,100
Eat your dinner.

775
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:27,340
Got it, Mr. George? I'll be back.

776
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:56,010
Hey, man, you... you remember Samantha?

777
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,540
Fine-ass Samantha.

778
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,000
Yeah, I remember her.

779
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:03,670
Yeah?

780
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,340
Check this out.

781
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,640
Kevin Jr.

782
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,240
Me and Samantha, man.

783
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:22,240
We had him young. Shit, too young.

784
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:28,120
Man, when I got locked up, man, that shit was hard.

785
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,380
Wasn't no way I could go back the streets, man. Not after this.

786
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,510
- Y'all still down?
- Me and Sam?

787
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:40,720
Nah. I mean, we... we cool.

788
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,390
We gotta be, you know,because of little man, but...

789
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:46,480
Nah, not like that, man.

790
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:50,260
But what about you, bruh?

791
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:54,820
What about me?

792
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,860
Nigga... tell me somethin'.

793
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,490
I mean, what you doing?

794
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:03,020
Who you doing?

795
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:09,070
Man, come on now. I've been back there in that kitchen, man,

796
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,000
and cooked for your ass and everything, man.

797
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:15,000
Hey, these grandma rules, man. You know the deal.

798
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:17,750
Your ass eat, your ass speak.

799
01:31:24,430 --> 01:31:26,430
All right... straight up?

800
01:31:26,510 --> 01:31:28,090
Yeah, nigga, straight up.

801
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:32,480
I'm trappin'.

802
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:39,240
- What?
- Yeah.

803
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,450
When they sent me to Atlanta,

804
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,530
put me straight into juvie for beating the old boy.

805
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:47,400
Met this dude in there.

806
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:51,030
When I come out, he put me on the block.

807
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,210
Did good at it and rose up.

808
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,710
It is what it is.

809
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:01,010
Bullshit, man.

810
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:03,710
That ain't what it is.

811
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,100
That ain't you, Chiron.

812
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:10,840
Nigga, you don't know me.

813
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,900
I don't know you?

814
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,370
There you are.

815
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:42,370
Twenty-four fifty. Want the change?

816
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:44,760
- All right.
- Bye.

817
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:09,030
Why you got them damn fronts, man?

818
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,420
Why'd you call me?

819
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,760
What?

820
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,870
Why did you call me?

821
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:13,010
I told you, man.

822
01:34:13,090 --> 01:34:15,880
- Dude came in...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...

823
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:25,820
He played this song, man...

824
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:09,540
Hello stranger

825
01:35:13,170 --> 01:35:18,220
It seems so good to have you back again

826
01:35:18,230 --> 01:35:21,260
How long has it been?

827
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:27,900
It seems like a mighty long time.

828
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:38,610
It seems like a mighty long time.

829
01:35:38,780 --> 01:35:48,880
Oh I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm so glad

830
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:54,510
you stopped by to say hello to me

831
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:58,300
Remember that's the way it used to be

832
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:01,470
it seems like...

833
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:41,250
This you?

834
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,420
You wasn't playing about them traps, huh?

835
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,140
Ride dirty, huh?

836
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,770
Something like that.

837
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,120
So, how you be getting to work?

838
01:37:18,360 --> 01:37:21,150
Bus. Jitney.

839
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:25,540
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out there when I got little Kev.

840
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:31,300
I can't picture being in Miami with no car.

841
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:34,670
- Man, it's real out here.
- Yeah, I bet.

842
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:39,880
Real hot, real slow, and real busted.

843
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:42,350
Shot me like a duck out here, man.

844
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:45,020
This nigga said "a duck."

845
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:48,150
- Yeah, you on one. You on one.
- You know what I'm doin'.

846
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,320
Nah, I'm just tired, bruh.

847
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:54,150
Hey, man, bet on the ride, though.

848
01:37:54,230 --> 01:37:56,270
- Yeah.
- Appreciate it.

849
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:58,160
Yeah, man.

850
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,990
Can't have yo ass on no Jitney.

851
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:08,420
So, Chiron...

852
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:15,380
What... what you looking at me like that for?

853
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:18,380
What, man? Come on, you just drove down here?

854
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:23,920
Yeah.

855
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:30,560
Like you was just... you was just on one... and you hit the highway?

856
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:36,600
Yeah.

857
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:46,830
So where you gon' stay tonight, man?

858
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,970
- Watch that shit.
- I got you.

859
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,800
This is the spot.

860
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:54,300
- This the spot.
- What?

861
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:06,320
Come on in. Get yourself at home.

862
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:18,170
- This is real, man.
- I'm just... get out of this real quick.

863
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:34,180
You a'ight?

864
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:38,140
No. Yeah, no, I just got a little headache.

865
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,980
Man, you a lightweight.

866
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:45,360
Nah, you was pouring that mug. You was pouring it.

867
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,690
- "I can't taste this".
- Chill out, man.

868
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,080
We had like three bottles.

869
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:52,330
Yeah, three bottles. I'll make you some green tea, man, come on.

870
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:54,210
I won't be drinking that shit either, man.

871
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:56,630
- What do you drink?
- Water.

872
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:28,320
Who is you, man?

873
01:41:29,910 --> 01:41:31,450
Who, me?

874
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:33,030
Yeah, nigga. You.

875
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,420
I'm saying, man, them fronts. That car.

876
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:40,080
Who is you, Chiron?

877
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:45,620
I'm me, man. I ain't trying to be nothing else.

878
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:48,500
Oh, okay. So you hard now?

879
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:50,960
I ain't say that.

880
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:52,300
Well, then what?

881
01:41:55,810 --> 01:42:00,400
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't trying to hem you up, man, it's just...

882
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,320
I ain't seen you in a minute and...

883
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,310
It's not what I expected.

884
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:09,440
Well, what did you expect?

885
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:19,530
You remember...

886
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:23,830
You remember the last time I saw you?

887
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:32,670
For a long time, tried not to remember.

888
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:36,380
Tried to forget all those times.

889
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:42,860
Yeah.

890
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:48,560
When we got to Atlanta... I started over.

891
01:42:49,570 --> 01:42:53,700
Built myself from the ground up. Built myself hard.

892
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:01,580
What about you? You...

893
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:02,910
Me?

894
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:09,840
I wasn't never really worth shit.

895
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,760
Just kept on, man.

896
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:19,510
Never really did anything I actually wanted to do.

897
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:24,070
It was all I could do was to do what folks thought I should be doing.

898
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:26,890
I wasn't never really myself.

899
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,280
And now?

900
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,740
Now?

901
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:37,820
Now, man...

902
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:40,250
Now I got little Kev.

903
01:43:40,330 --> 01:43:41,830
Got this job.

904
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:44,960
Another 18 months of probation.

905
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,910
That's some real shit, man.

906
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,460
Nah, man, it's a life. You know?

907
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:57,470
I ain't never had that before. Like...

908
01:43:58,510 --> 01:44:00,260
Like, I'm tired as hell right now, man,

909
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:03,270
and I ain't making no more than shoe money, but...

910
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:06,850
I ain't got no worries, man.

911
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:09,490
Not them kind what I had before.

912
01:44:10,650 --> 01:44:12,360
That's that real shit.

913
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:15,950
That's that Bob Marley shit, nigga.

914
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,350
You the only man that's ever touched me.

915
01:44:45,230 --> 01:44:46,860
You're the only one.

916
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,770
I haven't really touched anyone since.
