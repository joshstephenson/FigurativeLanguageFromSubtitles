We accept that
we had to sacrifice...

a whole Saturday in detention
for whatever it was we did wrong.

All right, people, we're going to
try something different today.

78
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,119
We are going to write an essay...

- When I say "essay," I mean essay.

Hey. Cherry.

177
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:37,192
- Do you belong to the physics club?
- That's an academic club.

178
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,860
So?

179
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,822
So academic clubs aren't
the same as other kinds of clubs.

180
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:47,202
Ah, but to dorks
like him, they are.

181
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,622
What do you guys do in your club?

182
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:55,335
In physics, well, we talk about
physics, uh, properties of physics.

183
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,420
So it's sort of social.

184
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:00,632
Demented and sad,
but social, right?

185
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,052
I guess you could consider it
a social situation.

186
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,097
Um, there are
other children in my club.

187
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,392
And, uh, at the end of the year,
we have, um...

188
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:15,021
- a big banquet at the Hilton.
- You load up. You party.

189
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:19,693
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

190
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,653
Only burners like you get high.

191
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,072
I didn't have shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

192
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,825
My mom doesn't like me to wear
other people's shoes.

193
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,578
My cousin Kendall
from lndiana got high once.

194
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,831
He started eating, like,
really weird foods...

195
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,583
and then he felt
like he didn't belong anywhere.

196
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,919
Kind of "Twilight Zone," kinda.

197
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,004
Sounds like you.

198
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:42,215
You guys keep talking
and Vernon's gonna come in here.

199
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,385
I got a meet Saturday, and I'm not
missing it because of you boneheads.

200
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,679
Oh, wouldn't that be a bite, huh?

201
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:49,681
Missing a whole wrestling meet?

202
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,850
You wouldn't know about it, faggot.

203
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,893
You never competed
in your life.

204
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,771
Oh, I know.
I feel all empty inside.

205
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:01,276
I have such a deep admiration for guys
who roll around with other guys.

206
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,820
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.

207
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,739
- But I do.
- Yeah?

208
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,575
I want to be just like you.

209
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,328
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

210
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,373
You wear tights?

211
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,917
No, I don't wear tights.

212
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,462
I wear the required uniform.

213
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,671
Tights.

214
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,006
Shut up.

215
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,315
Ooh.

216
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,945
There's not supposed to
be any monkey business.

217
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,490
Young man, have you
finished your paper?

218
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,038
Bender, don't screw around.

219
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,332
- What are you gonna do?
- Drop dead, I hope.

220
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,052
All right!

221
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,262
Bender, that's school property.

222
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:14,933
It doesn't belong to us.
It's not to be toyed with.

223
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,852
- Very funny. Fix it.
- You should fix that.

224
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,938
- Am I a genius?
- No, you're an asshole.

225
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,482
- Funny guy. Everyone, just shh.
- Fix the door, Bender!

226
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,360
- I know what I'm doing.
- Fix the door!

227
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,903
Shut up!

228
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,571
[ Vernon ] Goddamn it!

229
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,911
Why is that door closed?

230
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,208
Why is that door closed!

231
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,961
How are we supposed to know?
We can't move, right?

232
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,921
Why?

233
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:49,384
We're just sitting here,
like we're supposed to.

234
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,600
Who closed that door?

235
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,438
- I think a screw fell out of it.
- It just closed, sir.

236
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,774
- Who!
- Aah!

237
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,028
- She doesn't talk, sir.
- Eek!

238
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,197
- Give me that screw.
- I don't have it.

239
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,575
You want me
to shake it out of you?

240
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,952
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.

241
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,622
- The world's an imperfect place.
- Give it to me, Bender.

242
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:23,710
- Sir, why would anybody steal a screw?
- Watch it, young lady.

243
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,389
The door's way too heavy, sir.

244
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,314
Damn it!

245
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,199
Andrew Clark, get up here.

246
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:56,743
Front and center.
Let's go.

247
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,955
- How come Andrew gets to get up?
- [ Vernon ] That's right.

248
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,292
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
lt'll be anarchy.

249
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,255
- Okay, watch the magazines.
- [ Bender ] It's out of my hands.

250
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,553
That's very clever, sir...

251
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,972
but what if there's a fire?

252
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,058
I think violating fire codes...

253
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,103
and endangering the lives
of children would be unwise...

254
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,188
at this juncture

in your career, sir.

255
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,983
What are you doing?
Get this out, for God's sake.

256
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:33,488
- What's the matter with you?
- The school's equipped with fire exits.

257
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,825
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

258
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,411
Get in your seat.

259
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,668
I expected more
from a varsity letterman.

260
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,839
You're not fooling anybody, Bender.

261
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,843
The next screw that
falls out will be you.

262
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,511
Eat my shorts.

263
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,929
What was that?

264
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,099
Eat...

265
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,225
my...

266
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,476
shorts.

267
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,562
You just bought
another Saturday, mister.

268
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,439
Oh, I'm crushed.

269
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,316
- One more right there.
- I'm free the next Saturday.

270
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:14,571
- Beyond that, I'll check my calendar.
- Good! It's gonna be filled.

271
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,282
We'll keep going.
You want another one?

272
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,784
Say the word. Just say it.

273
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,328
lnstead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

274
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,749
- Are you through?
- No.

275
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,834
- I'm doing society a favor.
- So?

276
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,627
That's another!

277
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,547
I've got you the rest of your life
if you don't watch it.

278
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,591
- You want another?
- Yes.

279
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,844
You got it!
That's another one, pal.

280
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,971
Cut it out!

281
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,515
- Stop.
- You through?

282
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,352
- Not even close, bud.
- Good!

283
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,521
- You got one more.
- You really think I give a shit?

284
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,482
Another.

285
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,819
- You through?
- How many is that?

286
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,238
That's seven including the first one
when you asked...

287
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,824
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

288
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,369
- Now it's eight. Stay out of it.
- Sir, it's seven.

289
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,454
Shut up, peewee.

290
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,711
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got you.

291
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,881
I got you.

292
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,051
What can I say?
I'm thrilled.

293
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,054
That's exactly what you
want them to believe.

294
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,764
You know something?

295
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,517
You should spend more time
doing something with yourself...

296
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,228
and less time trying
to impress people.

297
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,063
Might be better off.

298
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,065
Right, that's it!

299
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:34,359
I'll be outside those doors.

300
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:39,030
The next time I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

301
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:52,335
Fuck you!

302
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,264
Fuck.

303
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,575
Wake up!

304
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,164
Who has to go to the lavatory?

305
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,935
That's real intelligent.

306
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,437
You're right.

307
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,897
It's wrong to destroy literature.

308
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:20,859
It's such fun to read.

309
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,319
And...

310
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:28,450
"Molay" really pumps my 'nads.

311
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,784
Moliere.

312
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,914
I love his work.

313
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,632
Big deal.

314
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:48,053
Nothing to do,
locked in a vacancy.

315
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,138
Ah, speak for yourself.

316
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,183
You think I'd speak for you?

317
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,894
I don't know your language.

318
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,312
Hey...

319
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,647
you grounded tonight?

320
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:04,194
I don't know. My mom said I was,
but my dad said to blow her off.

321
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:12,202
There's a big party at Stubby's.
Parents are in Europe.

322
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,454
- It should be pretty wild.
- Yeah?

323
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:18,458
- Yeah. Are you going to go?
- I doubt it.

324
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,626
How come?

325
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:23,713
If I disobey my mother,
it's because my father says it's okay.

326
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,966
It's like this whole monster deal.
It's endless and a total drag.

327
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:30,762
- Any minute, divorce.
- Who do you like better?

328
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,724
- What?
- You like your old man better?

329
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:38,436
- They're both screwed.
- I mean if you had to choose.

330
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,524
I don't know.

331
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,235
I'd probably go live
with my brother.

332
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,364
I don't think either one
gives a shit about me.

333
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,491
They use me to get back
at each other.

334
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:52,909
Ha!

335
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,294
Shut up!

336
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:07,924
- You're feeling sorry for yourself.
- If I didn't, nobody else would.

337
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,676
You're breaking my heart.

338
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,428
- Sporto?
- What?

339
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,515
You get along with your parents?

340
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,184
If I say yes,
I'm an idiot, right?

341
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,605
You're an idiot anyway...

342
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:26,359
but if you say yes,
you're a liar too.

343
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:36,119
You know something, man?

344
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,913
If we weren't in school right now,
I'd waste you.

345
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:40,832
Can you hear this?

346
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,419
You want me to turn it up?

347
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,005
Hey, fellas, I mean--

348
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,675
I don't like my parents, either.
I mean, I don't--

349
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:53,595
I mean, I don't get along
with them when...

350
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:57,599
their idea of parental compassion
is just, you know...

351
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,852
wacko, you know?

352
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,896
- Dork.
- Y eah?

353
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:06,066
You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

354
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,195
That's the problem.

355
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,405
Look, I can see you're getting
all bunged up...

356
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,657
for them making you wear
these clothes...

357
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:17,744
but, face it,
you're a neo-maxi-zoom-dweeby.

358
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:21,498
What would you do if you weren't out
making yourself a better citizen?

359
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,792
Why do you have to
insult everybody?

360
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,253
I'm being honest, asshole.

361
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:30,507
I would expect you
to know the difference.

362
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,467
- Well, he's got a name.
- Yeah?

363
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,844
Yeah. What's your name?

364
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,930
- Brian.
- See?

365
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,265
My condolences.

366
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,269
What's your name?

367
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,608
What's yours?

368
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,528
- Claire.
- Claire?

369
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:55,490
- Claire. It's a family name.
- It's a fat girl's name.

370
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,200
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

371
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,576
- I'm not fat.
- Not now...

372
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,954
but I can see you really
pushing maximum density.

373
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,331
You see, I'm not sure
if you know this...

374
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,750
but there are
two kinds of fat people.

375
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:09,087
There's fat people
that were born to be fat...

376
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,507
and fat people that were
once thin but became fat.

377
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,719
When you look at them, you can
sorta see that thin person inside.

378
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:20,515
You're gonna get married,
squeeze out a few puppies and then...

379
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,312
Oh.

380
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,941
Obscene finger gestures
from such a pristine girl.

381
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm not that pristine.

382
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,158
Are you a virgin?

383
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,248
I'll bet you
a million dollars that you are.

384
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,626
Let's end the suspense.

385
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:52,672
Is it gonna to be
a white wedding?

386
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,841
Why don't you just shut up?

387
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:56,885
Have you kissed
a boy on the mouth?

388
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,098
Have you ever been felt up...

389
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:04,392
over the bra...

390
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,019
under the blouse...

391
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:07,979
shoes off...

392
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,648
hoping to God
your parents don't walk in?

393
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:15,153
Do you want me to puke?

394
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,783
Over the panties...

395
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,660
no bra...

396
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:26,331
blouse unbuttoned...

397
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:32,003
Calvin's in a ball on the front seat
past 11:00 on a school night?

398
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,465
Leave her alone.

399
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,477
I said leave her alone.

400
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,356
You going to make me?

401
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,609
Y eah.

402
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:04,077
You and how many
of your friends?

403
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:06,454
Just me.

404
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,957
Just you and me.

405
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,876
Two hits. Me hitting you.
You hitting the floor.

406
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,920
Anytime you're ready, pal.

407
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,305
I don't want to get
into this with you, man.

408
00:29:26,224 --> 00:29:28,226
Why not?

409
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,687
'Cause I'd kill you.

410
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,567
It's real simple.

411
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:39,029
I'd kill you, and your
fucking parents would sue me.

412
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:42,991
And it'd be a big mess, and I don't
care enough about you to bother.

413
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:46,578
Chicken shit.

414
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:59,257
Let's end this now.

415
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,469
You don't talk to her.

416
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,596
You don't look at her.

417
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,931
And you don't even think about her!
Understand me?

418
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,186
I'm trying to help her.

419
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,250
Brian, how you doing?

420
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,089
Your dad work here?

421
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,804
- Uh, Carl?
- What?

422
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:49,057
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

423
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,644
- How does one become a janitor?
- You want to be a janitor?

424
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:55,855
No, I want to know
how one becomes a janitor...

425
00:30:55,939 --> 00:31:00,527
because Andrew's very interested
in a career in the custodial arts.

426
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,986
Really?

427
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:07,617
You think I'm some
untouchable peasant, serf, peon?

428
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,160
Y eah?

429
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:10,704
Maybe so.

430
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,206
From following a broom
after shitheads like you...

431
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,500
I've learned
a couple of things.

432
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,128
I look through your letters.

433
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,463
Look through your lockers.

434
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:24,050
I listen to your conversations.
You don't know that, but I do.

435
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:28,263
I am the eyes and ears
of this institution, my friends.

436
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,102
By the way,
that clock's 20 minutes fast.

437
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:38,231
Shit.

438
00:31:44,612 --> 00:31:47,949
## [ Whistling "Colonel Bogie's March" ]

439
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,064
## [ Whistling "Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony" ]

440
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,196
All right, girls.
Thirty minutes for lunch.

441
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,448
- Here?
- Here.

442
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:32,285
I think the cafeteria would be
a more suitable place, sir.

443
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:35,497
I don't care what
you think, Andrew.

444
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,748
Dick.

445
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,249
Excuse me, Rich.

446
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,669
Will milk be made available?

447
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,295
We're extremely thirsty.

448
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:45,131
I have a really low tolerance
for dehydration.

449
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:48,009
I've seen her dehydrate, sir.
It's pretty gross.

450
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:51,971
- Relax. I'll get it.
- Uh-uh-uh.

451
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,848
Grab some wood, bub.

452
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,643
You think I was born yesterday?

453
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,438
Think I'm going to let you
roam these halls?

454
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:03,692
You.

455
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:11,241
And you.

456
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,493
Hey!

457
00:33:14,202 --> 00:33:16,037
What's her name?
Wake her up.

458
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:18,915
Hey! Come on!
On your feet, Missy. Let's go.

459
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:21,042
This isn't a rest home.

460
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:24,170
There's soda
in the teachers' lounge.

461
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:26,339
Let's go!

462
00:33:31,219 --> 00:33:32,846
So...

463
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,931
what's your poison?

464
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,060
What do you drink?

465
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,689
Okay. Forget I asked.

466
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,359
Vodka.

467
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,612
Vodka?

468
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:52,115
When do you drink vodka?

469
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,242
Whenever.

470
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,954
- A lot?
- Tons.

471
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:00,707
Is that why
you're here today?

472
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,127
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

473
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,299
Um...

474
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,595
I'm here today because...

475
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,097
my coach and my father...

476
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,893
don't want me
to blow my ride.

477
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:22,103
I get treated differently...

478
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:26,066
because Coach thinks I'm a winner.
So does my old man.

479
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,735
I'm not a winner
because I want to be.

480
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,446
I'm a winner because
I have strength and speed.

481
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:34,032
Kinda like a racehorse.

482
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:37,077
That's about how involved I am
in what's happening to me.

483
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:38,620
Y eah?

484
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,624
That's very interesting.

485
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:49,506
Now, why don't you tell me
why you're really in here?

486
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,174
Forget it.

487
00:34:57,138 --> 00:35:01,601
Claire, want to see a picture of a guy
with elephantitis of the nuts?

488
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:04,396
- It's pretty tasty.
- No, thank you.

489
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:07,440
How do you think
he rides a bike?

490
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,111
Oh, Claire?

491
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:14,072
Would you ever consider
dating a guy like this?

492
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:17,033
- Can't you just leave me alone?
- If he had a great personality...

493
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,619
was a good dancer
and had a cool car?

494
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,663
You'd probably have to
ride in the backseat...

495
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,040
because his nuts
would ride shotgun.

496
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:30,213
- You know what I wish I was doing?
- Careful. Brian is a cherry.

497
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,966
- Cherry?
- I wish I was on a plane...

498
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,386
- to France.
- I'm not a cherry.

499
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:40,098
- When have you ever been laid?
- I've laid lots of times.

500
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:43,977
- Name one.
- She lives in Canada.

501
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:47,355
Met her at Niagara Falls.
You wouldn't know her.

502
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:49,274
Ever laid anyone around here?

503
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:54,654
Oh. You and Claire did it?

504
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:58,324
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

505
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:01,703
- Drop it. We'll talk about it later.
- Drop what?

506
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,581
Brian's telling me that,
in addition to a number of girls...

507
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,833
in the Niagara Falls area,
that presently...

508
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,002
you and he are
riding the hobby horse.

509
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:12,297
- Little pig.
- No, I'm not!

510
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,842
John said I was a cherry,
and I said I wasn't. That's it.

511
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,553
What were you motioning
to Claire for?

512
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:22,015
- I don't appreciate this, Brian.
- He is lying.

513
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,100
You weren't motioning
to Claire?

514
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:29,356
- You know he's lying.
- Were you or were you not?

515
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:32,233
Yeah, but it was only--

516
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:36,404
It was only because
I didn't want her to know I'm a virgin.

517
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,824
Excuse me for being a virgin.

518
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,994
Why didn't you want me to know?

519

Just take one shot.
That's all I need. Just one swing.

693
00:51:26,836 --> 00:51:28,838
That's what I thought.

694
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:32,967
You're a gutless turd.

695
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,802
A naked blonde walks into a bar...

696
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:18,805
with a poodle under one arm...

697
00:52:18,847 --> 00:52:21,808
and a salami under the other.

698
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:25,311
She lays the poodle on the table.

699
00:52:25,353 --> 00:52:29,232
Bartender says,
"You won't be needing a drink."

700
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:30,984
Naked lady says--

701
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,820
Oh, shit!

702
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,157
Jesus Christ almighty!

703
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,330
Forgot my pencil.

704
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,671
[ Vernon ] Goddamn it!

705
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:56,426
What in God's name
is going on in here?

706
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:01,014
- What was that ruckus?
- What ruckus?

707
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:03,683
I was in my office
and I heard a ruckus.

708
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:07,687
- Could you describe the ruckus, sir?
- Watch your tongue, young man.

709
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,315
Ah!

710
00:53:11,316 --> 00:53:12,942
What is this?

711
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:15,278
- Vvvvt!
- What is that?

712
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,530
What is that noise?

713
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:20,867
- What noise?
- Really, sir, there wasn't any noise.

714
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:25,080
- Ah!
- Ah!

715
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,208
Ow!

716
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:33,588
Was that the noise
you were talking about?

717
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:36,883
That was not the noise
I was talking about.

718
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:41,137
I may not have caught you
in the act this time...

719
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,390
- but you can bet I will.
- [ Laughing ]

720
00:53:43,473 --> 00:53:45,809
You make book on that, missy.

721
00:53:47,268 --> 00:53:48,603
And you!

722
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:52,107
I will not be made a fool of.

723
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,451
Ah!

724
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,499
It was an accident.

725
00:54:09,582 --> 00:54:11,501
You're an asshole.

726
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:13,086
Sue me.

727
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:23,096
Ahab, can I have all my doobage?

728
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,608
Y o, wastoid, you're not
gonna blaze up in here.

729
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:24,574
Shit.

730
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:23,508
Chicks cannot hold dey smoke.

731
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:25,552
That's what it is.

732
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:32,684
[ Claire ] Do you know
how popular I am?

733
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,602
I am so popular.

734
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:37,647
Everybody loves me
so much at this school.

735
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:39,899
Sure they do.

736
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:35,747
Whoo!

737
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:44,714
- Ow!
- Aagh!

738
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:55,183
Aaahhh!

739
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:02,982
Mister...

740
00:58:03,024 --> 00:58:05,735
Oh, Mr. Tierney.

741
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:09,406
"A history of
slight mental illness."

742
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,575
No wonder
he's so fucked up.

743
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:14,077
Good afternoon, Dick.

744
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,537
Hey, Carl.

745
00:58:15,578 --> 00:58:17,872
How you doing?
What's up?

746
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:19,624
Not much.

747
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:21,835
What are you doing
in the basement files?

748
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:24,295
Oh, nothing.
Just a little homework.

749
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,339
- Homework, huh?
- Y eah.

750
00:58:28,883 --> 00:58:30,885
Confidential files, huh?

751
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,765
Look, Carl, this is a highly
sensitive area, and I'll tell you...

752
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,018
certain people would be
very, very embarrassed.

753
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:41,730
I'd really appreciate it
if this would be something...

754
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:44,232
that you and I could--
we could keep between us.

755
00:58:44,315 --> 00:58:48,278
- What'll you do for me, man?
- What would you like?

756
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:51,197
- Got 50 bucks?
- What?

757
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:53,074
Fifty bucks.

758
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:56,661
No, no, no, man.

759
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:58,955
You got a middle name?

760
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,623
Y eah, I guess.

761
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:03,752
Your middle name is Ralph.

762
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:05,337
As in "puke."

763
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:09,424
Your birthday is March 12th...

764
00:59:09,466 --> 00:59:11,426
you're 5'9 1/2"...

765
00:59:11,468 --> 00:59:13,428
you weigh 130 pounds...

766
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,930
and your social security number...

767
00:59:15,972 --> 00:59:21,644
is 049-38-0913.

768
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,105
Wow!

769
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,607
Are you psychic?

770
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:27,150
No.

771
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:32,489
How do you know
all this about me?

772
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:37,369
I stole your wallet.

773
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:38,661
- Give it to me.
- No.

774
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:40,622
Give it.

775
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:44,417
- This is great. You're a thief too?
- I'm not a thief.

776
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:46,836
- Multi-talented.
- What's there to steal?

777
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:49,798
- Two bucks and a beaver shot.
- A what?

778
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:52,509
He's got a nudie picture.
I saw it. It's perverted.

779
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:53,760
Let's see it.

780
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,647
- Are all these your girlfriends?
- Some of them.

781
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,732
What about the others?

782
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,443
Well, some I consider
my girlfriends...

783
01:00:10,485 --> 01:00:13,113
- and some I just consider.
- Consider what?

784
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:16,282
Whether or not
I want to hang out with them.

785
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:18,868
You don't believe
in one guy, one girl?

786
01:00:20,078 --> 01:00:24,124
- Do you?
- Y eah. That's the way it should be.

787
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:27,627
- Well, not for me.
- Why not?

788
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:30,463
How come you got
so much shit in your purse?

789
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:33,633
- Why do you have so many girlfriends?
- I asked you first.

790
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:37,220
I don't know.
I guess I never throw anything away.

791
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:39,472
Neither do l.

792
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,684
Oh.

793
01:00:42,767 --> 01:00:46,271
This is the worst
fake l.D. I've ever seen.

794
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:48,982
You realize you made yourself 68?

795
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:52,986
- I know. I goofed it.
- What do you need a fake l.D. for?

796
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,030
So I can vote.

797
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:59,242
You want to see
what's in my bag?

798
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:00,744
- No.
- No.

799
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:17,969
Holy shit.

800
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:23,224
- What is all that stuff?
- Do you always carry this much shit?

801
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:25,518
Yeah.

802
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:29,272
I always carry
this much shit in my bag.

803
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:33,276
You never know
when you may have to jam.

804
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,654
Are you going to be,
like, a shopping bag lady?

805
01:01:37,822 --> 01:01:41,368
Like, sit in alleyways
and talk to buildings.

806
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:45,538
- Wear men's shoes.
- I'll do what I have to do.

807
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,582
Why do you have to do anything?

808
01:01:49,417 --> 01:01:51,544
My home life...

809
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,881
is unsatisfying.

810
01:01:54,964 --> 01:01:59,302
You'd subject yourself to the
violent dangers of Chicago's streets...

811
01:01:59,386 --> 01:02:01,763
because your home life
is unsatisfying?

812
01:02:01,846 --> 01:02:03,973
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

813
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,142
I can run away,
and I can go to the ocean...

814
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:09,729
the country, the mountains,
lsrael, Africa...

815
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:11,773
Afghanistan.

816
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:22,701
Andy, you want to get in on this?

817
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:25,995
Allison says she
wants to run away...

818
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,083
because her home life
is unsatisfying.

819
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:33,670
Well, everyone's home life
is unsatisfying.

820
01:02:35,463 --> 01:02:38,425
If it wasn't, people would
live with their parents forever.

821
01:02:38,466 --> 01:02:40,301
Yeah, I understand,
but I think hers...

822
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:44,389
goes beyond
what guys like you and me...

823
01:02:44,472 --> 01:02:46,850
consider "normal" unsatisfying.

824
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,853
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

825
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:54,983
- What's the deal?
- No. There's no deal, sporto.

826
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,278
- Forget it. Leave me alone.
- Wait a minute.

827
01:02:58,361 --> 01:03:01,322
You're carrying all that crap
in your purse.

828
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:04,951
Either you really want to run away
or you want people to think that.

829
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,746
Eat shit.

830
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:13,543
The girl is an island
unto herself. Okay?

831
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:24,304
Hi.

832
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:28,141
- You want to talk?
- No.

833
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:29,267
Why not?

834
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:31,978
Go away.

835
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,899
- Where do you want me to go?
- Go away.

836
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:49,537
- You have problems.
- Oh, I have problems?

837
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:52,582
You do everything everybody tells you!
That is a problem.

838
01:03:52,665 --> 01:03:55,251
Okay, fine. But I didn't dump
my purse out on the couch...

839
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:57,337
and invite people
into my problems.

840
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:01,007
Did l?

841
01:04:05,845 --> 01:04:10,225
So what's wrong?
What is it?

842
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:18,983
Is it bad? Real bad?

843
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,945
Parents?

844
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,212
Y eah.

845
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:50,765
What did they do to you?

846
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,061
They ignore me.

847
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,773
Y eah.

848
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:03,778
Y eah.

849
01:05:05,905 --> 01:05:10,827
What did you want to be
when you were young?

850
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,997
I wanted to be John Lennon.

851
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,458
Carl, don't be a goof.

852
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:19,169
I'm trying to be serious.

853
01:05:19,252 --> 01:05:23,089
Carl, I've been
teaching for 22 years.

854
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,259
And each year...

855
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,511
these kids get more arrogant.

856
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:30,013
Aw, bullshit, man.

857
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:31,514
Come on, Vern.

858
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:35,101
The kids haven't
changed, you have.

859
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:39,314
You're teaching because you thought
it would be fun.

860
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:42,567
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

861
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:45,362
Then you discovered
it was work.

862
01:05:45,445 --> 01:05:47,447
That bummed you out.

863
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:51,493
These kids turned on me.

864
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,830
They think I'm a big fucking joke.

865
01:05:55,914 --> 01:05:57,332
Come off it.

866
01:05:57,415 --> 01:05:59,334
If you were 16...

867
01:05:59,417 --> 01:06:02,170
what would you think of you?

868
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:06,383
Do you think I care
what these kids think?

869
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:07,967
Y es, I do.

870
01:06:10,011 --> 01:06:11,471
Think about this.

871
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,473
When we get old...

872
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:16,976
these kids will
be running the country.

873
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,312
Y eah.

874
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:22,023
This thought
wakes me at night--

875
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:24,067
When I get older...

876
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:27,696
these kids will take care of me.

877
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:30,240
I wouldn't count on it.

878
01:06:34,035 --> 01:06:37,914
What would I do
for a million bucks?

879
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:40,500
As little as I had to.

880
01:06:41,459 --> 01:06:43,670
- That's boring.
- How am I supposed to answer?

881
01:06:43,753 --> 01:06:48,216
The idea is to search your mind
for the absolute limit.

882
01:06:48,299 --> 01:06:52,429
Like, would you
drive to school naked?

883
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:00,270
- Would I have to get out of the car?
- Of course.

884
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:04,649
- In the spring or winter?
- Doesn't matter. Spring.

885
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:08,236
- In the front or back of school?
- Either one.

886
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,155
Y es.

887
01:07:10,238 --> 01:07:12,532
I'd do that.

888
01:07:12,615 --> 01:07:16,036
I'll do anything sexual.
I don't need a million dollars either.

889
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:20,457
- You're lying.
- I already have.

890
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:23,960
I've done just about everything
except a few things that are illegal.

891
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,213
I'm a nymphomaniac.

892
01:07:27,964 --> 01:07:29,799
Lie.

893
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:34,888
- Are your parents aware of this?
- I've only told my shrink.

894
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:39,225
- What did he do when you told him?
- He nailed me.

895
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:44,064
Very nice.

896
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:47,817
I don't think, from a legal standpoint,
what he did...

897
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:50,320
can be construed as rape
since I paid him.

898
01:07:50,403 --> 01:07:54,491
- He's an adult.
- Y eah. He's married too.

899
01:07:54,574 --> 01:07:58,828
Ugh. Do you have any idea
how completely gross that is?

900
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:01,664
- Well, the first few times--
- "The first few times"!

901
01:08:02,248 --> 01:08:04,709
- You mean he did it more than once?
- Sure.

902
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:08,088
- Are you crazy?
- Obviously. She's screwing her shrink.

903
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:11,508
Have you ever done it?

904
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,888
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

905
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:19,307
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

906
01:08:19,349 --> 01:08:22,936
- Didn't we already cover this?
- You never answered.

907
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:27,816
I won't discuss my private life
with total strangers.

908
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:31,319
- It's kind of a double-edged sword.
- A what?

909
01:08:31,486 --> 01:08:34,364
Well, if you say you haven't,
you're a prude.

910
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:37,617
If you say you have,
you're a slut.

911
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:41,037
It's a trap.
You want to, but you can't.

912
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:43,540
Then when you do,
you wish you didn't. Right?

913
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:47,002
- Wrong.
- Or are you a tease?

914
01:08:48,336 --> 01:08:50,005
She's a tease.

915
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,589
I'm sure.
Why don't you forget it?

916
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:53,925
You're a tease and you know it.
All girls are teases.

917
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:56,219
She's only a tease
if what she does gets you hot.

918
01:08:56,302 --> 01:09:00,515
- I don't do anything!
- That's why you're a tease.

919
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:04,102
- Let me ask you something.
- I told you everything.

920
01:09:04,185 --> 01:09:06,980
Doesn't it bother you to sleep around
without being in love?

921
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:10,734
- Don't you want respect?
- I don't screw to get respect.

922
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:12,819
That's the difference
between you and me.

923
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,863
That's not the only difference.

924
01:09:14,946 --> 01:09:17,782
- Face it. You're a tease.
- I'm not a tease!

925
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:20,744
Sure you are. Sex is your weapon.
You said it yourself.

926
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:22,829
You use it to get respect.

927
01:09:22,912 --> 01:09:26,666
I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

928
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,836
- What do you use it for then?
- I don't use it, period!

929
01:09:29,919 --> 01:09:33,548
Oh, are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

930
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:36,926
I didn't mean it that way.
You're putting words into my mouth!

931
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:38,845
Just answer the question.

932
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:42,140
- [ Andy ] Be honest.
- [ Brian ] No big deal. Answer it.

933
01:09:42,223 --> 01:09:44,184
- Answer the question, Claire.
- Talk to us.

934
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:46,728
[ All The Guys ]
Come on. Answer it.

935
01:09:46,811 --> 01:09:50,774
- [ Bender ] It's only one question.
- No! I never did it!

936
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,238
I never did it either.

937
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:01,868
I'm not a nymphomaniac.

938
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,912
I'm a compulsive liar.

939
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,540
You are such a bitch!

940
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:10,877
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over.

941
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,589
I would do it.
If you love someone, it's okay.

942
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,385
I can't believe you.
You're so weird.

943
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:20,970
You don't say anything all day.
Then, when you open your mouth...

944
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:24,057
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

945
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:27,727
You're just pissed off because
she got you to admit to something.

946
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:30,105
Fine, but that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

947
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:33,817
What's bizarre?
We're all pretty bizarre.

948
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:36,569
Some of us are better at hiding it.

949
01:10:36,653 --> 01:10:38,738
How are you bizarre?

950
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,992
He can't think for himself.

951
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:46,413
She's right.

952
01:10:46,454 --> 01:10:50,291
Know what I did to get in here?

953
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:56,423
I taped Larry Lester's
buns together.

954
01:10:56,464 --> 01:10:58,091
That was you?

955
01:10:58,174 --> 01:10:59,634
You know him?

956
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:01,636
Yeah, I know him.

957
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:06,016
Then you know how hairy he is.

958
01:11:06,099 --> 01:11:08,727
When they pulled the tape off...

959
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:11,938
most of his hair
and some skin came too.

960
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,314
Oh, my God.

961
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:16,818
And the bizarre thing is...

962
01:11:17,777 --> 01:11:19,946
that I did it for my old man.

963
01:11:21,656 --> 01:11:23,992
I tortured this poor kid...

964
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:27,829
because I wanted him
to think I was cool.

965
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:31,750
He was always going off about...

966
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,127
you know, when he was in school...

967
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,921
all the wild things
he used to do.

968
01:11:37,839 --> 01:11:41,051
I got the feeling
he was disappointed...

969
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:43,470
that I never cut loose
on anyone, right?

970
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:48,767
So I'm sitting in the locker room...

971
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,520
and I'm taping up my knee...

972
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:56,566
and Larry's undressing...

973
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:58,985
a couple of lockers down from me.

974
01:12:00,987 --> 01:12:03,740
And he's kind of--

975
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:07,160
He's kind of skinny, weak.

976
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,873
I started thinking
about my father...

977
01:12:12,707 --> 01:12:15,460
and his attitude
about weakness.

978
01:12:17,295 --> 01:12:19,297
The next thing I knew...

979
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:24,552
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

980
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:30,266
My friends just laughed
and cheered me on.

981
01:12:33,603 --> 01:12:35,438
And afterwards...

982
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,276
when I was sitting
in Vernon's office...

983
01:12:43,029 --> 01:12:45,031
all I could think about...

984
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:48,201
was Larry's father...

985
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,996
and Larry having to go home...

986
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:58,086
and explain what happened to him.

987
01:13:01,214 --> 01:13:04,092
And the humiliation...

988
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:09,222
the fucking humiliation
he must have felt.

989
01:13:12,517 --> 01:13:15,311
It must have been unreal.

990
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:21,067
How do you apologize
for something like that?

991
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:27,198
There's no way.

992
01:13:31,244 --> 01:13:34,122
It's all because
of me and my old man.

993
01:13:37,834 --> 01:13:39,836
God, I fucking hate him.

994
01:13:42,422 --> 01:13:44,090
He's like this--

995
01:13:44,132 --> 01:13:47,427
He's like this mindless machine
I can't relate to anymore.

996
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:50,930
"Andrew!

997
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:53,975
You've got to be number one!

998
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:57,062
I won't tolerate
any losers in this family.

999
01:13:57,145 --> 01:13:59,105
Your intensity
is for shit!

1000
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:01,649
Win! Win! Win!"

1001
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:05,862
You son of a bitch.

1002
01:14:08,865 --> 01:14:11,951
You know, sometimes,
I wish my knee would give.

1003
01:14:13,328 --> 01:14:15,997
Then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

1004
01:14:17,123 --> 01:14:19,668
Then he could forget all about me.

1005
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,838
I think your old man and mine
should get together and go bowling.

1006
01:14:30,095 --> 01:14:32,013
Like with my grades...

1007
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:34,516
like when l-- when l--

1008
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:39,521
like when I step outside
of myself, you know?

1009
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:44,359
And I see me...

1010
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:50,657
I don't like what I see.

1011
01:14:50,699 --> 01:14:52,242
I really don't.

1012
01:14:52,325 --> 01:14:54,786
What's wrong with you?

1013
01:14:54,869 --> 01:14:58,832
Why don't you like yourself?

1014
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:01,209
Sounds stupid, but...

1015
01:15:04,546 --> 01:15:06,589
because I'm failing shop.

1016
01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:09,551
We had this assignment,
you know...

1017
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:12,220
to make this ceramic elephant.

1018
01:15:13,221 --> 01:15:14,514
And, um...

1019
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:16,016
we're supposed to--

1020
01:15:16,057 --> 01:15:18,518
It was like a lamp.

1021
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,064
When you pull the trunk,
the light goes on.

1022
01:15:24,524 --> 01:15:26,651
My light didn't go on.

1023
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:31,281
I got an "F" on it.

1024
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,534
I've never got an "F" in my life.

1025
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:37,579
When I signed up for the course...

1026
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:39,706
I thought I was playing it smart.

1027
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:42,250
I thought, "I'll take shop.
lt'll be such an easy way...

1028
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:44,294
to maintain
my grade point average."

1029
01:15:44,377 --> 01:15:47,380
Why'd you think it'd be easy?

1030
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:50,884
Have you seen
some of the dopes that take shop?

1031
01:15:50,967 --> 01:15:54,929
I take shop.
You must be a fucking idiot.

1032
01:15:54,971 --> 01:15:56,765
Because I can't make a lamp?

1033
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:59,434
No, you're a genius
because you can't make a lamp.

1034
01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:04,064
- What do you know about trigonometry?
- I could care less about it.

1035
01:16:04,105 --> 01:16:06,983
Without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering.

1036
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:10,737
- Without lamps, there'd be no light.
- So neither of you is better--

1037
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:14,157
I can write with my toes.

1038
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:18,661
I can also eat, brush my teeth--

1039
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:22,499
- With your feet?
- Play the piano.

1040
01:16:22,582 --> 01:16:26,461
- I can make spaghetti.
- What can you do?

1041
01:16:28,129 --> 01:16:31,341
I can, uh,
tape all your buns together.

1042
01:16:31,424 --> 01:16:35,303
- I want to see what Claire can do.
- I can't do anything.

1043
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,097
Everybody can do something.

1044
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,184
There's one thing I can do.

1045
01:16:41,267 --> 01:16:43,353
Forget it.
It's way too embarrassing.

1046
01:16:43,436 --> 01:16:47,273
Ever seen "Wild Kingdom"?
He's been on for 30 years.

1047
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:50,110
Okay.

1048
01:16:50,443 --> 01:16:52,904
You have to swear to God
you won't laugh.

1049
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:58,118
Okay.

1050
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:03,665
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

1051
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:19,639
That's great!

1052
01:17:19,681 --> 01:17:22,684
Where'd you learn to do that?

1053
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:24,519
Camp, seventh grade.

1054
01:17:30,358 --> 01:17:32,485
That was great, Claire.

1055
01:17:32,527 --> 01:17:35,822
My image of you
is totally blown.

1056
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:38,575
You're a shit.
Don't do that to her.

1057
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:41,327
- You swore to God you wouldn't laugh.
- Am I laughing?

1058
01:17:41,411 --> 01:17:44,039
You fucking prick!

1059
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:48,752
What do you care what I think?

1060
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:52,505
I don't even count, right?

1061
01:17:52,547 --> 01:17:56,259
I could disappear forever
and it wouldn't make any difference.

1062
01:17:58,261 --> 01:18:02,599
I may as well not even exist
at this school. Remember?

1063
01:18:06,019 --> 01:18:08,855
And, you,
don't like me anyway.

1064
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:11,816
I have just as
many feelings as you do.

1065
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:14,527
And it hurts just as much
when somebody steps on them.

1066
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:16,529
God, you're so pathetic!

1067
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:18,573
Don't you ever...

1068
01:18:18,656 --> 01:18:21,659
ever, compare yourself
to me, okay?

1069
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:24,537
You got everything,
and I got shit.

1070
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,873
Fucking Rapunzel, right?

1071
01:18:26,998 --> 01:18:30,210
School would probably shut down
if you didn't show up!

1072
01:18:30,251 --> 01:18:32,671
Queenie isn't here.

1073
01:18:33,004 --> 01:18:35,340
I like those earrings, Claire.

1074
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:36,716
Shut up.

1075
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,260
- Are those real diamonds, Claire?
- Just shut up.

1076
01:18:39,302 --> 01:18:41,304
I bet they are.

1077
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:45,558
- Did you work for the money for those?
- Shut your mouth.

1078
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:48,770
- Or did Daddy buy them for you?
- Shut up!

1079
01:18:48,853 --> 01:18:51,022
I bet he bought those.

1080
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:54,859
I bet those were
a Christmas gift, right?

1081
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,903
Know what I got for Christmas?

1082
01:18:56,986 --> 01:18:59,823
It was a banner-fucking-year
at the Bender family.

1083
01:18:59,906 --> 01:19:01,825
I got a carton of cigarettes.

1084
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:04,077
The old man grabbed me and said,
"Smoke up, Johnny."

1085
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:08,540
Go home and cry to your daddy.
Don't cry here, okay?

1086
01:19:21,386 --> 01:19:24,305
Will we be like our parents?

1087
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:26,057
Not me...

1088
01:19:29,227 --> 01:19:30,562
ever.

1089
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:34,274
It's unavoidable.

1090
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:37,569
Just happens.

1091
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:39,988
What happens?

1092
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,951
When you grow up...

1093
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:46,453
your heart dies.

1094
01:19:46,494 --> 01:19:47,787
Who cares?

1095
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:50,957
I care.

1096
01:19:50,999 --> 01:19:55,628
I was just thinking,
I mean...

1097
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:59,466
I know it's kind
of a weird time...

1098
01:19:59,507 --> 01:20:02,469
but I was just
wondering, um...

1099
01:20:02,510 --> 01:20:05,138
what will happen
on Monday?

1100
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,474
When we're all together again.

1101
01:20:07,515 --> 01:20:10,518
I consider you guys my friends.

1102
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:14,647
Am I wrong?

1103
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:17,150
No.

1104
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:20,779
So on Monday, what happens?

1105
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:22,781
Still friends, you mean?

1106
01:20:22,864 --> 01:20:25,158
If we're friends now?

1107
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,368
Yeah.

1108
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:28,912
Want the truth?

1109
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:31,373
Yeah, I want the truth.

1110
01:20:31,456 --> 01:20:33,833
I don't think so.

1111
01:20:35,543 --> 01:20:38,171
With all of us or just John?

1112
01:20:38,254 --> 01:20:41,216
With all of you.

1113
01:20:41,299 --> 01:20:45,220
- That's a real nice attitude, Claire.
- Oh, be honest, Andy.

1114
01:20:45,261 --> 01:20:48,181
If Brian came up to you on Monday,
what would you do?

1115
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:52,644
Picture this.
You're there with all the sports.

1116
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:55,563
You know exactly what you'd do.
You'd say hi and when he left...

1117
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:59,192
you'd cut him up so your friends
wouldn't think you really liked him.

1118
01:20:59,818 --> 01:21:01,653
No way.

1119
01:21:01,736 --> 01:21:04,698
Okay. What if I came up to you?

1120
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:08,118
- The same exact thing.
- You are a bitch!

1121
01:21:08,201 --> 01:21:12,038
Why? Because I'm telling
the truth, I'm a bitch?

1122
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,874
No! 'Cause you know how shitty
that is to do to someone.

1123
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:19,546
And you don't have the balls
to stand up to your friends.

1124
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:21,715
What about you, you hypocrite?

1125
01:21:21,798 --> 01:21:25,218
Why don't you take Allison
to a heavy metal vomit party.

1126
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:30,140
Take Brian or Andy out to
the parking lot to get high. Or me?

1127
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:33,393
What would your friends say if we were
walking down the hall together?

1128
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:35,437
They'd laugh their asses off.

1129
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,231
You'd say we were doing it,
so they'd forgive you.

1130
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:43,236
Don't talk about my friends! You don't
know them. You don't look at them.

1131
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:46,322
And you certainly wouldn't
condescend to speak to them.

1132
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:50,785
Just stick to what you know: shopping,
nail polish, your father's BMW...

1133
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:54,039
- your drunk mother in the Caribbean--
- Shut up!

1134
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:58,543
As far as being concerned about us
walking down the hallways together.

1135
01:21:58,626 --> 01:22:00,128
Forget it!
lt'll never happen!

1136
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:03,506
Just bury your head
and wait for your fucking prom!

1137
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:06,634
- I hate you!
- Yeah? Good!

1138
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:15,935
I assume Allison and I are
better people than you guys?

1139
01:22:16,811 --> 01:22:18,772
Us weirdos?

1140
01:22:22,984 --> 01:22:26,279
- Would you do that to me?
- I don't have any friends.

1141
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:31,910
- Well, if you did?
- No.

1142
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:36,790
I don't think my kind
of friends would mind.

1143
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:42,462
I just want to tell each of you
that I wouldn't do that.

1144
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:45,965
I wouldn't and I will not.

1145
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:49,636
Because I think that's real shitty.

1146
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,183
Your friends wouldn't mind
because they look up to us.

1147
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:01,648
You're so conceited, Claire.

1148
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:04,317
You're so conceited.

1149
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:06,653
You're so full of yourself. Why?

1150
01:23:07,237 --> 01:23:09,906
I'm not saying that
to be conceited.

1151
01:23:10,532 --> 01:23:13,868
I hate having to go along
with everything my friends say.

1152
01:23:13,952 --> 01:23:16,037
Then why do you do it?

1153
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:19,499
I don't know. I don't--

1154
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,961
You don't understand.
You don't--

1155
01:23:23,878 --> 01:23:27,215
You're not friends with the people
Andy and I are friends with.

1156
01:23:27,882 --> 01:23:32,012
You don't understand the pressure
they can put on you.

1157
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:34,723
I don't understand what?

1158
01:23:34,806 --> 01:23:37,517
You think I don't
understand pressure?

1159
01:23:37,559 --> 01:23:39,102
Well, fuck you!

1160
01:23:39,185 --> 01:23:41,021
Fuck you!

1161
01:23:48,903 --> 01:23:52,365
You know why I'm here today?

1162
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:54,034
Do you?

1163
01:23:58,246 --> 01:24:01,374
I'm here...because...

1164
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:05,503
Mr. Ryan found
a gun in my locker.

1165
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:13,053
- Why'd you have a gun?
- I tried.

1166
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:18,892
You pull the fucking trunk...

1167
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,102
and the light's supposed to go on.

1168
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:24,064
It didn't go on.
I mean, l--

1169
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:29,152
- What's the gun for?
- Just forget it.

1170
01:24:29,235 --> 01:24:31,404
You brought it up, man.

1171
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:35,992
I can't have an "F".

1172
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:40,747
I can't have it...

1173
01:24:42,207 --> 01:24:44,751
and I know
my parents can't have it.

1174
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,255
Even if I ace
the rest of the semester...

1175
01:24:49,297 --> 01:24:53,259
I'm still only a "B."
Everything's ruined for me.

1176
01:24:53,802 --> 01:24:55,804
Brian.

1177
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:04,604
Considering my options,
you know?

1178
01:25:04,729 --> 01:25:08,149
- Killing yourself is not an option.
- I didn't do it, did l!

1179
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:10,026
No. I don't think so.

1180
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:12,153
It was a handgun?

1181
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:17,283
It was a flare gun.
Went off in my locker.

1182
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:19,619
Really?

1183
01:25:21,621 --> 01:25:23,456
It's not funny.

1184
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:39,973
Yes, it is.

1185
01:25:42,183 --> 01:25:44,686
Fucking elephant was destroyed.

1186
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:49,357
Know what I did
to get in here?

1187
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:52,902
Nothing.

1188
01:25:52,986 --> 01:25:56,573
I didn't have anything
better to do.

1189
01:26:02,203 --> 01:26:04,330
You're laughing at me.

1190
01:26:04,372 --> 01:26:05,623
No.

1191
01:26:05,707 --> 01:26:07,334
Yeah, you are.

1192
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,486
# It seems so clear in black and white #

1193
01:26:34,569 --> 01:26:38,239
# The living color
tends to dull our sight #

1194
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:41,659
# Like dynamite #

1195
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:44,412
# Just imagine my surprise #

1196
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:48,416
# When I looked into your eyes and saw #

1197
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,502
# Through your disguise #

1198
01:26:51,836 --> 01:26:54,255
# If we dare expose our hearts #

1199
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:56,758
# And just reveal the purest thoughts #

1200
01:26:56,841 --> 01:27:01,763
# And that is when
sensations start to grow #

1201
01:27:01,846 --> 01:27:04,099
# We are not alone #

1202
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:06,601
# You find out
where you're coming from #

1203
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:11,773
# There'll be somebody there
to break your fall #

1204
01:27:11,856 --> 01:27:14,109
# We are not alone #

1205
01:27:14,192 --> 01:27:16,444
# 'Cause when you
look out through the door #

1206
01:27:16,528 --> 01:27:20,865

Brian?

1208
01:27:54,649 --> 01:27:55,608
Hmm?

1209
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:58,111
Are you going to write your paper?

1210
01:27:58,153 --> 01:27:59,654
Yeah. Why?

1211
01:28:01,656 --> 01:28:05,785
It's a waste for all of us
to write our paper.

1212
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:08,038
Vernon wants us to.

1213
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:12,375
True, but I think
we'd all kinda say the same thing.

1214
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:17,047
You just don't want
to write your paper, right?

1215
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:19,090
True, but...

1216
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:20,967
you're the smartest, right?

1217
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:22,844
Well...

1218
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:26,348
We trust you.

1219
01:28:28,558 --> 01:28:30,393
Yeah.

1220
01:28:32,228 --> 01:28:34,230
All right.

1221
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:36,941
I'll do it.

1222
01:28:37,233 --> 01:28:39,235
Great.

1223
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:52,665
Come on.

1224
01:28:52,707 --> 01:28:54,834
Where are we going?

1225
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,378
Come on.

1226
01:28:58,546 --> 01:29:00,507
[ Claire ] Don't be afraid.

1227
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:04,094
Don't stick that in my eye.

1228
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,263
I'm not sticking it. Just--
Go like that.

1229
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:11,601
- [ Claire ] Good.
- [ Squealing ]

1230
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:17,315
You look better without all that
black shit on your eyes.

1231
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:19,901
Hey, I like that black shit.

1232
01:29:21,403 --> 01:29:23,363
This looks a lot better.

1233
01:29:23,613 --> 01:29:25,448
Look up.

1234
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:34,874
[ Snorting ] Please.

1235
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:38,003
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1236
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,713
'Cause you're letting me.

1237

[ Door Opening ]

1238
01:29:56,771 --> 01:29:58,231
You lost?

1239
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,286
Thank you.

1240
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:02,087
Why'd you do that?

1241
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:04,673
'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

1242
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:09,803
You said before your parents use you
to get back at each other.

1243
01:31:09,886 --> 01:31:13,348
Wouldn't I be outstanding
in that capacity?

1244
01:31:16,142 --> 01:31:18,978
Were you really disgusted about
what I did with my lipstick?

1245
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,814
Truth?

1246
01:31:22,315 --> 01:31:23,274
Truth.

1247
01:31:24,484 --> 01:31:25,527
No.

1248
01:31:34,911 --> 01:31:36,996
What happened to you?

1249
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:40,750
Why? Claire did it.

1250
01:31:45,755 --> 01:31:47,507
What's wrong?

1251
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:50,677
Nothing's wrong. It's just...

1252
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,429
just so different.

1253
01:31:54,347 --> 01:31:56,933
I can see your face.

1254
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:59,394
Is that good or bad?

1255
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:02,439
That's good.

1256
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:18,788
See you, Brian.

1257
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:22,751
See you next Saturday.

1258
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:24,294

Dear Mr. Vernon...

1286
01:34:11,317 --> 01:34:13,987
We accept the fact
that we had to sacrifice...

1287
01:34:14,029 --> 01:34:17,574
a whole Saturday in detention
for whatever it was we did wrong.

1288
01:34:17,657 --> 01:34:22,037
We think you're crazy to make us
write an essay on who we think we are.

1289
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,289
You see us as
you want to see us...

1290
01:34:24,372 --> 01:34:28,001
in the simplest terms,
the most convenient definitions.

1291
01:34:28,084 --> 01:34:30,086
But what we found out...

1292
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:32,130
is that each one of us
is a brain...

1293
01:34:32,213 --> 01:34:36,217
- [ Andy ] and an athlete...
- [ Allison ] and a basket case...

1294
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:39,471
- [ Claire ] a princess...
- [ Bender ] and a criminal.

1295
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:41,931

Does that answer your question?

1296
01:34:42,474 --> 01:34:44,476
