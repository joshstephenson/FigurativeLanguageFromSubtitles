1
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,432
Do you ever look at someone and wonder...

2
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,386
what is going on inside their head?


3
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:57,322
well I know.


4
00:00:58,377 --> 00:00:59,511
I know Rylie's head


5
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:46,151
And there she was


6
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:49,758
Hello


7
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,632
Rylie

8
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:56,815
Oh look at you, aren't you a little bundle of joy


9
00:02:08,484 --> 00:02:10,035
Aren't you a little bundle of joy?

10
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:35,039
It was amazing, just Rylie and me ... forever


11
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:43,852
Oh for 33 seconds...


12
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:50,445
I am Sadness. Oh hello .. I am Joy


13
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,899
Can I just ... If you could ... I just wanna fix that ... Thanks.


14
00:02:56,148 --> 00:02:57,077
And that was just the beginning.


15
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,655
Headquarter's only got more crowded from there.


16
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,417
Very nice, looks like you got this .. very good


17
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:10,358
Ohhh look out! That's fear ... he's really good at keeping Rylie safe.


18
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:17,018
easy easy .. Ha! pop back!! Oh we are good. Thank you, thank you very much.


19
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:18,229
and we are back


20
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:24,439
Here we go, alright ... open


21
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,309
Mmmmm, this looks new ... Do you think it's safe? What is it?


22
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:31,460
Okay caution, there is a dangerous smell people. Oh hold on what is that? 


23
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:35,024
This is disgust, she basically keeps Rylie from being poisoned


24
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:40,638
physically and socially ... That is not redly coloured or shaped like a denis .. Hold on guys, it's broccoli!


25
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,327
Yuckii!!


26
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,847
well I just saved our lives. Yeah you are welcome. 


27
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:49,737
Rylie if you don't eat your dinner, you are not gonna get any desert


28
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,373
Wait! did he just say we couldn't have desert?!


29
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:56,511
That's anger, he cares very deeply about things beig fair.


30
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,254
So that's how you wanna play it old man?! No desert!


31
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:03,590
Oh sure, we will eat our dinner right after you eat this!


32
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,636
Ahhhhhhhhhh!!


33
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:10,659
Rylie Rylie ... here comes the airplane ... Ouuhhh!


34
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:14,317
Oh airplane, we got an airplane everyody. Ohhhh!



35
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,160
And you've met Sadness, she .. well she ..



36
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,225
 I am not actually sure what she does.

37
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:38,242
and I've checked, there is no place for her to go so she is good, we are good, it's all great.



38
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:43,249
anyway these are Rylie's memories and they are mostly happy you'll notice ... not to brag



39
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,225
but the really important ones are over here. I don't wanna get too technical but these are

40
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,474
called core memories, each one came from a super important time in Rylie's life


41
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:01,852
like when she first scored a goal, it was so amazing


42
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,150
would you look at that? very nice.


43
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,098
Woahhhhhh !!


44
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,657
and each core memorie powers a different aspect of Rylie's personality.


45
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:24,941
like Hockey island ... 

46
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:29,419
goofball island is my persoanl favourite.

47
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,030
hahahaha! come back here you little monckey.


48
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,845
Yup goofball is the best.


49
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,801
friendship island is pretty good too.


50
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:45,469
ohhhh I love honesty island and that's the truth.


51
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,152
and of course family island is amazing.


52
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:55,323
the point is the islands of personality are what make Rylie Rylie.


53
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,830
Lavaaa ... Wohooouuh !


54
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,495
Who is your friend who rides a bike? Bing Bong Bing Bong 

55
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,822
Ahhhh! Brain freeze!


56
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,972
Yeahhh! yayyyy
 

57
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,718
Good night kiddo. 
Good night dad.

58
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,813
and ... we are out.


59
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,511
that's what i am talking about. Ohhh! Another perfect day.


60
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,467
Nice job everybody. Let's get those memories down to longterm.


61
00:06:53,134 --> 00:06:55,757
Alright! we knoked it out today, I am gonna call that success.


62
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,660
and that's it, we love our girl.


63
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:18,348
she's got great friends, she's got a great house.
Things couldn't be better.


64
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,185
After all Rylie is 11 now, what could happen?!


65
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,772
What!! Ahhhh!


66
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,129
Okay. Not what I had in mind.


67
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:33,747
Ahhhhh!


68
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,357
Hey look the golden gate bridge. Isn't that great?!


69
00:08:00,952 --> 00:08:04,278
It's not made out of solid gold like we thought which is kinda disapointment but still. 


70
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:09,259
A shrin belady told me earthquakes are a myth joy. Otherwise I will be terrified right now.


71
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:11,169
Ahhhh yeah.


72
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,655
these are my kind of people.


73
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,823
Alright just a few more blocks. we're almost to our new house.


74
00:08:19,476 --> 00:08:21,299
step on it daddy! why don't we just live in a smelly car?!


75
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:22,967
We've already been in it forever!


76
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,602
which actually was really lucky because that gave us plenty of time to think


77
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,972
about what our new house is going to look like.


78
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,047
Whattt! Let's review the top ideal dreams.


79
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:33,399
Ohhh that looks safe.


80
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,588
that looks nice.


81
00:08:35,017 --> 00:08:36,040
Ohhh! that would be great for Rylie.
 

82
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,838
Oh! No no no this. Joy for the last time she cannot live in a cookie.
  

83
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,261
That's the one, it comes with a dragon.

84
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:43,546
We are getting close, I can feel it.

85
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:48,215
This, this i our new house. Annnnd ...


86
00:08:55,022 --> 00:08:56,457
Maybe it's nice on the inside.


87
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:03,864
we are supposed to live here?!

88
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:06,593
we have to .. I am telling you it smells like something died in here!


89
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:07,733
Could you die from moving?!


90
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:11,029
guys you are overreacting, nobody is dy.. A dead mouse! 


91
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:12,355
AHHHHH!


92
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:14,684
I am gonna be sick. the house of the dead. What are we gonna do?
we are gonna get rebbies.

93
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:15,913
get of me!


94
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:19,928
Hey hey hey all through the drive. Dad talked about how cool our new room is.


95
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:21,126
let's go check it out.


96
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,272
It's gonna be great. Yes yes yes.


97
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:24,509
Noooo no no no.


98
00:09:24,957 --> 00:09:25,864
I am starting to envy the dead mouse.


99
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:28,212
get out the rubber ball. We're in a solitary confinment.

100
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,721
Rylie can't live here. He's right. That the worse. 
It's really bad. It's absolutely the worse.

101
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:36,994
Hey it's nothing our butterfly curtains couldn't fix.


102
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,255
I read somewhere that an empty room is an opportunity.


103
00:09:39,782 --> 00:09:40,541
where did you read that?

104
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,974
it doesn't matter. I read it and it's great.


105
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:44,362
We will put the bed there and the desk over there. 

106
00:09:44,771 --> 00:09:46,555
The hockey lamp goes there. We will put the chair there.

107
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:50,911
stars.. yeah I like that. Now we are talking.


108
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,890
Let's go get our stuff out from the moving van.

109
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,609
Alright goodbye. Well guess what?

110
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,318
the moving van won't be here until thursday. 
You are kidding.

111
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:02,781
the van is what?! Oh yeah. The van is lost.

112
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,208
You said it would be here yusterday.

113
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:06,748
I know that's what I said. That's what they told me.

114
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:09,223
We would better stress out! What are we gonna do?


115
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,022
I've got a great idea!

116
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:14,445
Did you even read the contract? 

117
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,319
and then she makes some move, she is closing in.
Hey oh no you are not.

118
00:10:20,313 --> 00:10:21,171
she is running over the grass.

119
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:23,617
and she scores.

120
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:25,614
yeahhh!

121
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:29,092
What grandma! Grandma?!

122
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,275
Oh she put her hair up, we're in for it.

123
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,388
Heyyy, put me down.

124
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:40,991
Ah sorry hold on, hold on.

125
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,388
Hello! Wait.

126
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:48,112
You are kidding, Ah stall it for me, I will be right there.

127
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:53,083
The investors are supposed to show up on thursday not today, I gotta go.

128
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:56,231
it's okay, we get it. I hope that's for the best, Thank's hon.

129
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:57,809
See you sweetie.

130
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:03,363
Dad just left us. Oh he doesn't love us anymore, that's sad.

131
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,429
I should drive, right?

132
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,371
Joy! What are you doing?

133
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:10,680
Ahhhh just give me one second.

134
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:14,636
You know what I realized? Rylie hasn't have launch, remember!

135
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,969
Hey I saw  a pizza place down the street .. maybe we could try that.

136
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:24,730
pizza sounds delecious. Pizza yes pizza.
Let's get it.

137
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:28,169
What the heck is that?!

138
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,504
Who puts brocolli on pizza?!

139
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:33,479
that's it. I am done.
Congratulations San Fransisco you've ruined pizza.

140
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,109
Fasta Hawaians and now you.

141
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,082
What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza?

142
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:41,835
It must be a San Fransisco thing.

143
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:45,782
still it's not bad as that soup, that dinner in Nabrasca.

144
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:48,929
Oh yeah the spoon stood up from the soup by itself.

145
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,900
That's disgusting. Oh good, family is running.

146
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:55,145
The drive was pretty fun, Ha?

147
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,106
What was your favourite part? Spitting out of the car window.

148
00:11:58,602 --> 00:11:59,800
Definitely not when Dad was singing.

149
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:01,204
wearing a seatbelt.

150
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:03,007
Ohh! what about the time with a dinosaur?

151
00:12:03,504 --> 00:12:04,545
Oh that's the one.

152
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:06,368
say cheese.

153
00:12:07,077 --> 00:12:09,495
Dad dad dad dad the car! Just look behind you.

154
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:11,851
Noo no no no.

155
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:14,570
Haha nice one Joy.

156
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,001
I liked that time with a dinosaur.

157
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:17,298
That was pretty funny.

158
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,095
Wait what?! what happened?

159
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:29,055
she did something to the memory!

160
00:12:31,034 --> 00:12:32,690
what did you do? I just touched it.

161
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,084
that should make it change. Ohhh change it back Joy.

162
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:36,528
I am trying. You can't change it back?!

163
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,218
No, I guess I can't. Good going Sadness, now when Rylie thinks of that moment with dad

164
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,514
she is gonna feel sad.

165
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:48,157
Bravo! I am sorry Joy, I don't really know .. I thought maybe if you .. if I .. I mean .. 

166
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:49,883
Joy we got a stairway coming up.

167
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,772
Just don't touch any other memory until we figure out what is going on.

168
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:55,951
Okay.

169
00:12:56,315 --> 00:13:00,459
Alright, get ready this is a monster railing and we are riding it all the way down.

170
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:09,004
wait what! what happened?

171
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:12,432
A core memory! Oh no!

172
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:18,394
Sadness what are you doing? it looked like it's almost crooked

173
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,031
so I opened it and then it fell out. 

174
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:26,867
Ohhhhh!

175
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:30,424
It's just that, I wanted maybe to hold one.

176
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,975
Ohhh Joy! Wow wow wow!

177
00:13:33,928 --> 00:13:38,612
Sadness you nearly touched a core memory and when you touch them we can't change it back.

178
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:40,192
I know, I am sorry.

179
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,498
something is wrong with me.

180
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:43,377
it's like I am having a breakdown.

181
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,352
you are not having a breakdown. It's stress. 
I keep making mistakes like that.

182
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,244
I am awful. No, you are not. and annoying.

183
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:54,549
Well, you know what you can't focus on what's going wrong.

184
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,665
there is always a way to turn things around, to find the fun.

185
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:01,668
yeah, find the fun. I don't know how to do that.

186
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:04,445
Okay, well try to think of something funny.

187
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,662
Ohhhh remember the funny movie where the dog dies?

188
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:13,259
Ah yeah, that's not .. What about that time with Meg when Rylie 

189
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:18,323
laughed so hard, milk came out of her nose. Come on.

190
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,488
yeah that hurt, it fel like fire.

191
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:26,650
Okay let's think about something else, what are your favourite things to do?

192
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,701
my favourite? Well I like it when we are outside.

193
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:36,809
that's good, like there is the beach and sunshine.
Oh like that time we burried dad in the sand up to his neck. 

194
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:43,606
I was thinking more like rain. Rain. 
Rain is my favourite too 

195
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:49,324
we can stumb around in puddles, you know? 
There is cool umbrellas, lightining storms.

196
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:55,556
More like when the rain runs on our back and makes your shoes thuggy and we get all cold and shivery

197
00:14:56,193 --> 00:15:02,645
everything starts feeling drobby. Oh hey hey easy, why are you crying?

198
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,522
it's like really the opposite of what we are going for here.

199
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:10,651
Crying helps me slow down an obsessive way of life's problems. 

200
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:17,672
you know what, let's think about something else, how about we read some mind manuals?

201
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:19,794
Ha? sounds fun. I've read most of them.

202
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:22,336
Well have you read this one? this one seems interesting.

203
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:27,897
"Longterm memory retrieval volume 47"? No. A real page turner.

204
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,333
Longterm memory data selection via channel subgrouping? see? Fun already.

205
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:36,692
Oh you lucky dog, you are reading these cool things, I gotta go work 


206
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:39,788
Life is so unfair. Ahhh!

207
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:50,969
what do we do? We only got half of the last month maybe two.

208
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:54,181
If we can't find investors by then, we are gonna have to lay people off. 

209
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:58,039
Mom! Dad! Come kiss me goodnight.

210
00:15:58,574 --> 00:16:00,599
Be right there! I know you gotta land this.

211
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:06,180
Did you hear Dad? He sounded really upset.

212
00:16:09,841 --> 00:16:10,884
What was that? Is it a bear? It's a bear!

213
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,152
There is not bears in San Fransisco.

214
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,072
I saw a really hairy guy, he looked like a bear.

215
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:18,937
I am so jumpy, my nerves are shut! 
Ohhh I don't want to hear about your nerves.

216
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:23,017
I'll tell you what it is, this move's been a bus.
That's what I have been telling you guys.

217
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,841
There is at least 37 things for Rylie to be scared of right now.

218
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,547
The smell alone is enough to make her gag.

219
00:16:27,994 --> 00:16:29,376
I can't believe mom and dad moved us here!

220
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:32,941
Look! I get it, you guys have concerns but we have been through worse.

221
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:36,924
I'll tell you what, let's make a list of all the things Rylie should be happy about.

222
00:16:37,585 --> 00:16:41,861
Fine. Let's see the house stinks, our room stinks 
it smells wierd here, our friends are back home.

223
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:43,895
and all of our stuff are in the missing van.

224
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:48,570
Oh come on, it could be worse. Yeah Joy, we could be lying on the dirty floor in a bag.

225
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:53,273
Okay I admit it, we had a rough start but think of all the good things that.. No Joy

226
00:16:53,673 --> 00:17:00,333
there is absolutely no reason for Rylie to be happy right now. Let us handle this.
I say we skip school tomorrow and lock oursleves in the bedroom.

227
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:03,868
We have no clean clothes, I mean no one should see us
We could cry until we can't breathe.

228
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:07,607
We should lock the door and say that curse word we know. It's a good one.

229
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:10,897
Now hold on, look we all have our off days you know? 

230
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:16,321
Hi honey. The mom bad news train is pulling in. Tut tut!

231
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:22,299
still no moving van, now they're saying it won't be here until Tuesday.
Can you believe it? Tut tut tut!

232
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,316
Where is dad? On the phone, this new van triskie has been relly busy.
I rest my case. 

233
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:34,675
your dad is a little stressed, he is about keeping his campagny up and running.
Now for a few well placed withering scouts.

234
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,391
I guess all I really wanna say is thank you. Ha?

235
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:46,700
you know, through all this confusion you've stayed, well you've stayed our happy girl.

236
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,604
your dad is under a lot of pressure but if you and I can keep smiling, it would be a big help.

237
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:56,251
We can do that for him, right? 

238
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:05,861
Wow! well, yeah sure.
What did we do to deserve you?

239
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,567
Sweet dreams.
Good night.

240
00:18:13,348 --> 00:18:17,681
well you can't argue with mom, happy it is.
Sounds great. Totally behind you Joy.

241
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:25,723
looks like we are going in a rpm. I've got dream duties so I'll take care of sending 
these to longterm. Great day today guys.

242
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:31,862
Alright what's on tonight dream production?

243
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,627
Oh this is it, the new place.


244
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:44,232
Come live with me Rylie

245
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:47,582
Somebody ordered a Brocolli pizza?

246
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:49,569
eat me! I'm organic.

247
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:56,197
No. Who is in charge of programming down there?
I know I am not supposed to do this but

248
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:03,570
We are not going to end the day like this.

249
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,761
Don't you worry, I'm gonna make sure that tomorrow is another great day.

250
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:54,816
I promise.

251
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,129
Hello! Did I wake you?

252
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:14,243
Do you have to play that? Well I have to practice and I don't think of it as 
playing so much as hugging.

253
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:19,986
Okay first day of school. very very exciting.
I was up late last night figuring out a new plan.

254
00:20:20,572 --> 00:20:25,381
Here it is, fear I need a list of all the possible negative outcomes on the first day at the new school.



255
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:27,591
Way ahead there, Did anyone notice a film mediore?

256
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,829
Disgust, make sure Rylie stands out today but also blends in.
When I am through, Rylie will look so good


257
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:35,117
the other kids will look at her own outfit and barf.


258
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:40,589
Joy! Yes Joy? You will be in charge of the console keeping Rylie
happy all day long and may I say I love your dress.

259
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:43,462
it's adorable. Oh! this old thing? Thank you so much.
I love the way it rolls.

260
00:20:45,206 --> 00:20:46,363
train of thoughts ... right on schedule.

261
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:52,847
Anger, unload the day dreams.
I ordered extra in case things get slow in class. 

262
00:20:53,324 --> 00:20:58,027
might come in handy if this new school is full of boring useless classes 
which it probably will be. 

263
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,924
Sadness, I have a super important job just for you.
Really? Hmmmm!

264
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:04,493
Follow me. 


265
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:08,309
What are you doing? 
And there perfect.

266
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,042
this is the circle of sadness.

267
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:14,929
your job is to make sure that all the sadness stays inside of it.

268
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,035
Sooo you want me to just stand here?

269
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:20,567
Hey, it's not my place to tell you how to do your job.

270
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:27,789
Just make sure that allll the sadness stays in the circle
See? You're a pro with this.

271
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:29,212
Isn't this fun?
No.


272
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,287
I gotta go.
Alright, everyone 

273
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:35,937
fresh start, we are gonna have a good day which will turn into a good 
week which will turn into a good year which turns into a good life.

274
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,573
Sooo big day, new school
new friends, Ha?

275
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:42,327
I know, I am kinda nervous but I am mostly excited 
How do I look?

276
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:47,028
very cute. You are gonna be okay?
Do you want us to walk with you?

277
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,591
Mom and dad with us in public?!
No thank you.

278
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,706
I'm on it. No, I'm fine.
Bye Mom, bye dad.

279
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:54,625
Have a good day at school monkey.

280
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:57,204
*Hoo hoo hoo*

281
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,157
Have a great day sweetheart.

282
00:22:08,616 --> 00:22:12,286
Are you sure we wanna do this? In we go.
Okay, going in ... yes.


283
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:22,384
Okay we gotta a group of cool girls at 2 o'clock.
How do you know? Double ears pairs, infinity scarf. 

284
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:26,190
Wow! is she wearing an eye shadow? We wanna be friends with them.
Oh let's go talk to them. 

285
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:29,113
Are you kidding?! We are not talking to them.
We want them to like us.

286
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:31,089
Ohhhh! Wait what?

287
00:22:31,478 --> 00:22:35,928
Almost finished with the potential disasters.
scenario is either quick sands, spontaneous combustion

288
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,531
or getting called on by the teacher.
So as long as none of this happens ..

289
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:45,343
Okay everybody, we have a new student in class today.
Are you kidding me?! Out of the gates, this is not happening!

290
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:49,405
Rylie, would you like to tell us something about yourself?
Nooooooooo.

291
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,809
pretend we can't speak english.
Don't worry, I got this.

292
00:22:53,348 --> 00:22:59,966
Oh okay, my name is Rylie Anderston.
I'm from Menasota and now I live here.

293
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:08,246
and how about Menasota? can you tell us something about it?
well you certainly get a lot more snow then we do.

294
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:13,318
Hahaha! she is so hilarious. Hahaha!

295
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,066
yeah it gets pretty cold. ... is over and tthat's when we play hockey.
I'm on a great team. We're called the perry dogs.

296
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:25,490
my friend Meg plays forward and my dad's a coach.
Pretty much, everyone in my family skates.   

297
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,696
It's kinda of a family tradition, we go out on the lake almost every weekend. 

298
00:23:32,832 --> 00:23:37,876
Or we did till I moved away...
What? Hey Sadness!

299
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:42,053
You touched a memory! We talked about this .
Oh yeah I know, I am sorry. 

300
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,481
Get back in your circle!
Oh what's going on?

301
00:23:47,944 --> 00:23:50,283
We used to play tag and stuff...


302
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,679
Did you see that look? They're judging us!

303
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:57,712
Somebody help me! Grap that.. Everybody put... 

304
00:23:58,422 --> 00:24:02,161
but everything is different now since we moved. 

305
00:24:04,926 --> 00:24:07,613
Oh no! We are crying at school!

306
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,038
What! Sadness what are you doing?

307
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:13,944
I'm sorry. 

308
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,225
Ah! It's a core memory.

309
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,724
It's blue.

310
00:24:20,545 --> 00:24:22,288
No, wait. Stop it.

311
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,574
No

312
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:33,574
Joy No! That's a core memory.

313
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:35,366
Stop it! Let go!

314
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:37,771
Ahhh! the core memories!

315
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,453
No no no no!

316
00:25:07,171 --> 00:25:12,256
Thank you Rylie, I know it can be tough moving to a new place
but we are happy to have you here.

317
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,795
Alright everyone get out your history books and turn to chapter 7 

318
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,255
Can I say that curse word now?

319
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,945
Ahhhhhh!

320
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:45,405
Oh no! 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. okay 

321
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,615
Where are we? 

322
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:52,758
Longterm memory! 

323
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,542
Goofball island?!

324
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:06,284
Rylie's islands of personality, they're all down!

325
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,253
Ohhhh! This is bad 


326
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:15,426
We... we can fix this 
We just have to get back to headquarters, plug the core memories in

327
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:17,181
and Rylie will be back to normal

328
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:24,893
Ohhh! Rylie has no core memories, no personality islands and no ..... 
What?! What is it?

329
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:30,444
You! You are not in headquarters, without you Rylie can't be happy.  

330
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,995
We gotta get you back up there. 

331
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:35,391
I'm coming Rylie

332
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:55,060
So as it turns out, the green trash can is not recycling 
it's for greens like combusts and egg shells..

333
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:57,777
and the blue one is recycling, and the black one ...  

334
00:26:58,206 --> 00:27:00,096
Rylie is acting so wierd, why is she acting so wierd?! 

335
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,355
What do you expect? All the islands are down  

336
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:03,834
Joy would know what to do 

337
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,653
That's it, until she gets back we just do what Joy would do 

338
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:12,151
great idea! Anger .. fear .. disgust .. How are we supposed to be happy?!

339
00:27:12,911 --> 00:27:18,440
Hey Rylie I've got good news .. I found a junior hockey league
right here in San Fransisco and get this

340
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:21,547
trials are tomorrow after school, what luck right! 

341
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:23,465
Hockey?! Oh oh what do we do?

342
00:27:23,884 --> 00:27:26,201
guys .... you ... you pretend to be Joy

343
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,091
Won't it be great to be back on the ice?

344
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,151
Oh yeah, that sounds fantastic.

345
00:27:33,396 --> 00:27:34,955
What was that?! That wasn't anything like Joy.

346
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:36,747
Ahhh! because I'm not Joy

347
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,246
yeah, no kidding

348
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:40,789
Did you guys pick up on that?!

349
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:43,564
Oh yeah! Something is wrong.
Should we ask her?

350
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,679
Let's probe but keep it settled so she doesn't notice.

351
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:49,346
So how was the first day of school?


352
00:27:49,863 --> 00:27:50,828
She's probing us...

353
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:52,336
I'm done, you pretend to be Joy.

354
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,868
Oh okay, Hmmm

355
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,779
It was fine, I guess... I don't know.

356
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,593
Oh very smooth ... that was just like Joy

357
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:04,509
something is definitely going on..
she never acted like this before 

358
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,836
What should we do? We're gonna find out what's happening


359
00:28:07,529 --> 00:28:09,631
but we will need support, signal the husband 

360
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:11,870
Hmmmm...

361
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:16,299
what a nice bat over the rief...

362
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:18,872
Hmmmmm...

363
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:21,929
Oh oh she is looking at us


364
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:24,004
What did she say?

365
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:26,291
Sorry sir, no one was listening

366
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,331
is it garbage night?! we left the toilet seat up
What?! what is it woman ... what?!

367
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:34,585
Ahh .. he's making that stupid face again
I could strangle him right now!

368
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,193
signal him again

369
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:41,052
Ahhh! so Rylie how was school?

370
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,281
Seriously!! you're kidding me

371
00:28:43,863 --> 00:28:46,007
for this we gave up a brazilian helicopter pilot!

372
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,302
Move I'll be Joy...
School was great, alright?!

373
00:28:50,994 --> 00:28:52,453
Rylie, is everything okay?

374
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,977
Ahhh!
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us

375
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:57,448
What is her deal?!

376
00:28:57,915 --> 00:29:00,476
Alright, make a show force 
I don't have to put the foot down

377
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:02,394
No, not the foot!

378
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:05,032
Rylie, I do not like this new attitude

379
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:07,906
Oh I'll show you attitude..
No, no no stay happy!

380
00:29:08,392 --> 00:29:10,974
What is your problem?!
Just leave me alone 

381
00:29:11,576 --> 00:29:12,880
Sir, reporting high level of sas

382
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:16,784
take it to deaf cone 2
You heard that gentlemen, deaf cone 2

383
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:21,732
Listen young lady, I don't know where this 
disrespectful attitude came from.  

384
00:29:22,481 --> 00:29:24,633
you wanna a piece of this pops?!
Come and get it.

385
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:26,580
Yeah well ... well

386
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:31,360
Here it comes, prepare the foot
keys inserted to position

387
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:35,149
Waiting to launch on your command, sir

388
00:29:38,051 --> 00:29:39,238
Just shut up!

389
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:41,690
Fire!


390
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,696
That's it, go to your room.

391
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,043
Now!

392
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:51,972
Foot is down.. The foot is down

393
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:54,620
Good job, gentlemen.

394
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:56,782
That could have been a disaster.

395
00:29:57,717 --> 00:29:58,778
Well, that was a disaster.

396
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:04,726
Come fly with me, Gargenya!

397
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:07,364
Ahhh!

398
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:19,714
We're gonna walk out there, on that!

399
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:26,006
It's the quickest way back.
But it's right over the memory dump, if we fall we'll be forgotten forever!

400
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:30,253
We have to do this for Rylie, just follow my footsteps.

401
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,877
Oh okay! 
It's not that high, it's totally fine.

402
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:43,992
Ohhhh!

403
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:55,541
Hey.
So things got a little out of hand down stairs

404
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:57,558
Don't you want to talk about it?


405
00:30:59,514 --> 00:31:01,112
Come on, where is my happy girl?

406
00:31:03,187 --> 00:31:05,252
Monkey! Woo woo woo...

407
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,859
Oh he's trying to start goofball

408
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:23,444
Ahhh! go back, go back

409
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,974
What the?!

410
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,878
I get it, you need some alone time.

411
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:15,242
We'll talk later.

412
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,393
We have a major problem

413
00:32:20,998 --> 00:32:22,244
Oh Joy where are you?!

414
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:30,052
We lost goofball island, that means she could loose friendship
and hockey and honesty and family... 

415
00:32:31,643 --> 00:32:33,384
you can fix this, right Joy?

416
00:32:34,477 --> 00:32:37,242
Ahh! I don't know
Ohhh!

417
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:38,528
But we have to try.

418
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:40,076
Okay, come on.

419
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:43,340
Rylie's gone to sleep...

420
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:48,985
which is a good thing, when you think about it because nothing else
bad could happen while she's asleep  

421
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,611
We'll be back to headquarters before she wakes up.
We'll just go across friendship island 

422
00:32:56,649 --> 00:33:02,072
Ohhh! We'll never make it. Ohh!
No no no, don't obsess the way of life problems, remember the funny movie where the dog dies.   

423
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,666
Oh Sadness! We don't have time for this.

424
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:08,171
We'll just have to go around, take the scener crew


425
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:10,947
Wait Joy you could get lost in there.

426
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:12,934
Think positive!

427
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:16,185
Okay, I'm positive you will get lost in there.

428
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:22,999
That's longterm memory, an endless warn of corners and shelfs
I've read it about it in the manuals.  

429
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:27,957
The manuals?! the manuals, you read the manuals! 

430
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:30,635
Yeah.
So you know the way back to headquarters. 

431
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:32,896
I ... I guess 
Ohhhh!

432
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,720
You are my map, let's go 
lead on my map.

433
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:40,432
Show me where we are going.

434
00:33:40,832 --> 00:33:47,237
Okay, only 
I'm too sad to walk, just give me a few hours to..

435
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:52,449
Oh! which way, left?
Right! No I mean go left 


436
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:54,698
I said left was right like correct.

437
00:33:55,478 --> 00:33:56,296
Okay.

438
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:57,892
This actually feels kinda nice.

439
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,866
Okay here we go, we will back to headquarters before morning.

440
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:04,017
We can do it, this will be easy.

441
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:05,721
This is working...

442
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:10,929
Ahhh! This is not working, are we getting close?

443
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:18,542
Yeah just another right anddd... a left and then another... left and ...



444
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:23,454
Ah! Are you sure you know where we're going cause we seem to be walking away from headquarters?!

445
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:34,872
Rylie is awake.
Oh! Oh ... No no don't touch, remeber? If you touch them they stay sad. 

446
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:38,673
Oh sorry, I won't... starting now.

447
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,824
Ohh! I can't take much more of this.

448
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,473
Forget them!
Mind workers!

449
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:46,073
But Joy we're almost .. Ohhh!

450
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:50,093
Phone numbers .. we don't need all of these, they're in her phone
Just forget all of them, please.

451
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,926
Forget them.

452
00:34:53,328 --> 00:34:57,047
I need to find friendship island.
Four years of piano lessons, yeah it looks pretty faded  

453
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,047
You know what, save chopsticks and hurt soul and get rid of the rest.

454
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:04,126
Are you?! US prisoners, what do you think?
Yeah she keeps watching Lincoln in the fab.


455
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:05,548
Forget them.

456
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:08,060
Hey, you can't throw these away.
Those are perfectly good memeories.

457
00:35:08,488 --> 00:35:13,686
the names of every cutie pie princess, no.
Yes, that's critical information, glitter storm, honey pence...  

458
00:35:14,232 --> 00:35:14,915
Forget them.

459
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:23,482
Hey, bring those back.
They're in the dump, nothing comes back from the dump.

460
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,900
Yeah, look lady this is our job
when Rylie doesn't care about a memorie, it fades. 

461
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,195
Fades?!

462
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:29,938
It happens to the best of them
Yeah except for this bad boy, hmmm

463
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:35,339
This one will never fade..
Tripple dent gum... will make you...

464
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:36,646
The song from the gum commercial?!

465
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:42,640
You know, sometimes we send that one up to headquarters for no reason.
It just plays in Rylie's head over and over again like a million times.


466
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:46,060
Let's watch it again.
Triple dent gum, will make you... 

467
00:35:46,975 --> 00:35:48,124
We all know this song, okay.

468
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,412
What do you think, shall we do it?

469
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:51,950
Yeah, ahahaha!

470
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:53,362
Here we go.

471
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,922
Triple dent gum...
What the?! This again!


472
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:02,534
Hey, do you know how to get to friendship island?

473
00:36:03,274 --> 00:36:04,715
Triple dent gum... hmmm
Did you like it there?

474
00:36:05,222 --> 00:36:06,926
Did you feel any earthquakes?
Is the brich cool?

475
00:36:07,569 --> 00:36:12,858
Yeah it's good, what happened with the play offs?
We won the first game, cause we actually may go to the finals this year.


476
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:15,818
Oh and we've got this new girl in the team, she's so cool.

477
00:36:16,899 --> 00:36:19,947
Ahhh! She did not just say that.
A new girl?! Meg has a new friend already!

478
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:24,474
Ohhh! 
Hey hey hey stay happy, we do not want to loose any more islands here guys.

479
00:36:25,077 --> 00:36:27,861
We can pass the pod to each other without even looking, it's like mind reading... 

480
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:31,066
You like to read minds? I got something for you to read... 

481
00:36:32,935 --> 00:36:34,055
Ahhhh!

482
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:36,655
I gotta go. What? I gotta go.

483
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,438
Please tell me which way is ... Oh no!


484
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,891
Friendship island! What?! 

485
00:36:59,377 --> 00:37:01,094
Ah, not friendship!

486
00:37:07,217 --> 00:37:14,491
Ohhh Rylie loved that one and now it's gone. 
Goodbye friendship, hello loneliness.

487
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:26,145
We'll just have to go the long way.
Yeah the long long long long way.

488
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:28,656
I'm ready.

489
00:37:29,678 --> 00:37:31,992
Hmmmm! there's gotta be a better way.

490
00:37:35,137 --> 00:37:36,765
Ohhh look at you.

491
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,812
Ahh! I will take you but not you.

492
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:41,944
Awww! Who am I kidding, I can't leave you.

493
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:46,344
Hellooo! Ahhhh!
Wait, hey wait!

494
00:37:48,265 --> 00:37:49,363
Wow wait, stop.

495
00:37:58,396 --> 00:37:59,653
Exuse me? Ahhhh!


496
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:03,235
Ahh .. I was looking for a ... diversion
What?!

497
00:38:04,121 --> 00:38:05,300
Ahhh! So long, sucker.

498
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,743
Awww! I hurt all over.

499
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:10,831
Wait, I know you.
No you don't, I get that a lot.

500
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:16,783
I look like a lot of people. No no no I do.
Ahhh! Bing Bong, Rylie's imaginary friend!


501
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:22,126
You really do know me?! Well of course, Rylie loves playing with you,
you too are best friends.
 

502
00:38:23,324 --> 00:38:25,184
Oh, oh you would know 
we're trying to get back to headquarters 

503
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:29,800
Headquarters?! Are you guys from headquarters?!
Well, oh yeah I'm Joy, this is Sadness. 

504
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:32,136
You're Joy?! The Joy?!
Hmmm.

505
00:38:32,602 --> 00:38:35,826
What the heck are you doing right here?!
That's a good question, you wanna answer that Sadness?

506
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:41,122
Ahhh! Without you, Rylie will never be happy.
We can't have that, we gotta get you back

507
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:46,311
Ah, I'll tell you what, follow me.
Ah, thank you. It is so great to see you again

508
00:38:46,787 --> 00:38:50,643
I gotta tell you, I am such a good fan of your work. 
Do you remember when you and Rylie were in a band?

509
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:56,514
I went to all of your concerts, yeah I blow a mean nose.
Watching you playing tag was such a treat! 

510
00:38:57,117 --> 00:38:58,032
Good time, we were all champs.

511
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:02,081
Oh and remember your rocket?
Of course, it runs on song power. 

512
00:39:02,578 --> 00:39:06,306
That's right, your theme song.
Who's your friend who likes to play? Bing Bong Bing Bong

513
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:09,353
His rocket makes you yell horray! Bing Bong Bing Bong

514
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:14,688
What exactly are you supposed to be?! 
You know it's unclear, I'm mostly cotton candy

515
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:20,312
 But shapewise I'm part cat , part elephant, part dolphin.
Dolphin?!  

516
00:39:24,414 --> 00:39:26,769
You gotta remember when Rylie was three, animals were all the rage.

517
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:31,831
The cow goes mow, the horse goes nay .. It's all people talked about that.
Yeah, yeah I guess that's true. 

518
00:39:32,156 --> 00:39:36,919
What are you doing out here?
Well that's not much for an imaginary friend lately so ....

519
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:47,116
You know... Hey hey don't be sad 
I'll tell you what when I get back to headquarters I'll make sure Rylie remembers you.

520
00:39:47,945 --> 00:39:52,910
You will? Of course, she would love that.
Ahhhh! This is the greatest day of my life... 

521
00:39:53,583 --> 00:40:03,358
Awwww aww! What's going on?
I cry candy, try the caramel, it's delecious.

522
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,523
Ohhh! Ahhh!

523
00:40:05,923 --> 00:40:08,568
Ohhh here use this. Thanks.
Oh hold on, wait a second.

524
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,157
It always get stuck at the bottom..

525
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,227
Here. 

526
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:19,911
What? It's imaginary.

527
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,910
Thanks, this will make it a lot easier to walk back to headquarters.

528
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,595
Walk?! We're not walking. 

529
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:27,252
We're taking the train of thoughts.

530
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:32,929
The train? Of course, that's so much faster but how do we catch it?

531
00:40:33,512 --> 00:40:37,095
Well it kinda goes all over the place but there is a station in imagination land.

532
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:39,558
I know a shortcut, come on this way.

533
00:40:40,707 --> 00:40:42,049
Ah I'm so glad we ran into you.

534
00:40:43,285 --> 00:40:45,505
The station is right here.
After you.

535
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,389
Joy! What?
Well I read about this place in the manual, we shouldn't go in there. 

536
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:54,420
Bing Bong says it's the quickest way to headquarters.
No, but Joy this is abstract thoughts.  

537
00:40:55,016 --> 00:41:01,351
What are you talking about? I go in here all the time, it's a shortcut you see?
D .. A .. N .. G .. E .. R .. shortcut! 

538
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,026
I'll proove it to you.

539
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,447
Look at me I'm close to the station cause I'm taking the shortcut.

540
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,363
Let's go around this way.
Almost there.

541
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:20,959
If you wanna walk the long way , go for it but Rylie needs to be happy.
I'm not missing that train, BingBong knows what he is doing.

542
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:24,442
He's part dolphin, they're very smart.
Well I guess.

543
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:48,542
Okay, what abstract concepts are we trying to comprehend today?
Ahhh, loneliness.

544
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:53,175
hmmm looks like there is something is in there, I'm gonna turn it on for a minute and 
burn out the cank.

545
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:58,530
What did I tell you, you'll be in headquarters in no time.
Ahhhh! Hey would you look at that?

546
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:02,446
Oh what's happening? Oh no they turned it on.

547
00:42:03,682 --> 00:42:04,637
I've never seen this before.

548
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:09,622
My face! My beautiful face 

549
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:16,209
What's going on?! We're abstracting, there are four stages.
This is the first, none objective fragmentation ... 

550
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,998
Alright, do not panic. What is important is that we all stay together.  

551
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,185
Oh! The second stage, we're deconstructing... 

552
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,133
I can't feel my legs. Oh here they are. 

553
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:31,759
Come here me.

554
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:37,045
We gotta get out of here before we are not even shape and colour.

555
00:42:37,718 --> 00:42:39,128
We'll get stuck here forever.

556
00:42:40,014 --> 00:42:43,091
Why did we come in here?! 
I told you it's a shortcut.

557
00:42:43,976 --> 00:42:44,890
The train.

558
00:42:49,514 --> 00:42:52,356
Oh no, we're two dimensional, that's stage three. 

559
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,325
We're getting no where.
Depth! I'm lacking depth!

560
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,932
Come on.

561
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:01,196
We can't fit.

562
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:03,367
Oh no we're not figuritive!

563
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:05,214
This is the last stage!

564
00:43:05,712 --> 00:43:06,831
We're not gonna make it.

565
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:11,833
Wait we're two dimensional, fall on your face.

566
00:43:23,362 --> 00:43:25,370
Stop, stooop!

567
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:29,293
Noo, you said it was a shortcut.

568
00:43:29,761 --> 00:43:34,498
I did but wow, we should have not got in there, that was dangerous.
They really should put up a sign. 

569
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:36,671
How long till the next train? 
Who knows?

570
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:39,609
But don't worry, there is another station that way.

571
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:44,565
The train always stops there, right before it goes to headquarters.
If we hurry we can catch it.

572
00:43:45,276 --> 00:43:46,950
This isn't another one of your shortcuts, is it? 

573
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:48,876
Hahahaha, yeah!

574
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,372
is there really another station? Aha, through there. 

575
00:43:55,854 --> 00:44:02,106
Welcome to imagination land.
Imagination land?! Sure, I come here all the time, I'm practically the mair. 

576
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:04,977
Hey, are you guys hungry?
There is french fries forest.

577
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:07,985
No way, hahaha.

578
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,497
Oh oh! Check it out, trophy town.

579
00:44:10,885 --> 00:44:13,193
Medals, ribbons, everyone is a winner.

580
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:18,614
I won first prize. Me too.
Ohhh, participation award.

581
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:21,758
Wait is that?! Look, it's cloud town.

582
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:24,104
Ahhhh that's my favourite.

583
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:25,856
Ohhh, it's so soft.

584
00:44:26,937 --> 00:44:32,425
Ohhh let me try.
Hey what's the big idea? You better fix that wall or else you're in a big trouble...

585
00:44:34,587 --> 00:44:36,281
Oh no lava, Ohhh!

586
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,191
Imagination land is the best.

587
00:44:40,885 --> 00:44:42,841
Oh this is not gonna be so interactive.

588
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,177
Hey look, the house of cards.

589
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:49,430
Oh wait, hang on just a minute.
Ah, your rocket. Yeahh!

590
00:44:50,044 --> 00:44:53,518
I stached it in there for safe keeping and now it's gonna send Rylie to the moon.

591
00:44:55,222 --> 00:44:56,653
Oh I'm sorry.
Great.

592
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,382
Ohhh I love imagination land.
Isn't it great? Amd there is always something new like...  

593
00:45:05,022 --> 00:45:06,843
Who the heck it that?!
Imaginary boyfriend.

594
00:45:07,778 --> 00:45:11,078
I would die for Rylie.
Ah I've never seen him before.

595
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,333
I live in Canada.
Anyway, this way through preschool world. We're nearly to the train.

596
00:45:17,356 --> 00:45:18,805
Rylie, here we come.
Ohhh!

597
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:27,225
This should be fun, new team, new friends. 
These kids look pretty good, consider they're from San Fransisco.  

598
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,441
Gotta go. 
Okay, good luck sweetie.

599
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:38,226
Luck isn't gonna help us now, if she tries to use hockey island it's going down.
Which is why I've recalled every hockey memory I can think of.

600
00:45:38,868 --> 00:45:42,624
One of these's gotta work in place of the core memory.
She's about to play. Hurry.

601
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:54,042
Aha we did it gang, it's working... Ahh!

602
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:13,345
Haha! No, no no.
It's like we don't learn anything.

603
00:46:21,206 --> 00:46:23,107
That's it. No no no, free on your happy place.

604
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:37,697
Rylie what's wrong? 
Let's go.

605
00:46:38,261 --> 00:46:40,101
You are not gonna finish tryouts?
What's the point?

606
00:46:40,558 --> 00:46:44,236
Hey, it will be alright, let's just...
Stop saying everything is gonna be alright!

607
00:46:57,282 --> 00:46:58,647
Hockey!

608
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:05,060
Oh no no, she loves hockey.
She can't give up hockey!

609
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:11,989
Bing Bong we have to get to that station.
Sure thing, this way just pass crankpacker castle.

610
00:47:12,593 --> 00:47:15,893
Hey, wierd! Cranckpacker castle used to be rigt here.
I wonder why they moved it.

611
00:47:16,622 --> 00:47:20,905
Ah that's odd I would have sworn mouse was right here.
Hey, what's going on?! 

612
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:29,295
Yeah yeah I don't know, we will have to come back.
Princess's dream world! Oh the stuffed animal hall of fame! 

613
00:47:31,426 --> 00:47:39,011
My rocket! Wait, Rylie and I were too used to that rocket, it's still have some song power left.
Who's your friend who likes to play? 

614
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:50,669
Nooooo, you can't take my rocket to the dump.
Rylie and I are going to the moon.

615
00:47:57,284 --> 00:47:59,029
Rylie can't be done with me!

616
00:48:05,356 --> 00:48:08,197
Hey it's gonna be okay, we can fix this.

617
00:48:09,005 --> 00:48:11,351
We just need to get back to headquarters, which way to the train station? 

618
00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:20,111
I had a whole trip planned for us. 
Hey, who's ticklish , Ha? Here comes the tickle monster.

619
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:24,490
Hey Bing Bong look at this.. Bliah bliah!!

620
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:34,098
Oh here's a fun game, you playing to the train station and we all go there.
Wouldn't that be fun? Come on, let's go to the train station.

621
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:44,054
I'm sorry they took your rocket, they took something tht you loved.
It's gone ... forever

622
00:48:44,941 --> 00:48:48,765
Sadness, don't make him feel worse.
Sorry. It's all I had left of Rylie.  

623
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:54,186
I bet you and Rylie had great adventures.
Oh, they were wonderful.   

624
00:48:55,152 --> 00:49:01,759
 Once we flew back in time, we had breakfast twice that day.
Sadness! It sounds amazing, I bet Rylie liked it. 

625
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:08,958
Oh she did, we were best friends.
Yeah, it's sad.   

626
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:27,130
I'm okay now.
Come on the train station is this way.

627
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:39,108
How did you do that? 
I ... I don't know, he was sad so I listened to what ... 

628
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:40,870
Hey! there is the train. 

629
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:55,199
We made it, we're finally gonna get home. 

630
00:49:56,901 --> 00:50:02,011
Oh no these facts and opinions look so similar.
Don't worry about it, happens all the time.

631
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,508
On a scale of one to ten I give this day an F.
Well why don't we quit standing around and do something?

632
00:50:13,073 --> 00:50:20,043
Like what genius? Like quitting, that's what I'm doing.
I'm sure it's the coward's way out but this coward is gonna survive.

633
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:33,059
Emotions can't quit genius.
I thought we were supposed to be keeping Rylie happy.

634
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:35,571
Wait a minute, wait a minute. 

635
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:41,304
Aha, ho ho ho.

636
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:44,196
What is it? Oh nothing, just the best idea ever.

637
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:51,949
What? All the good core memories were made in Menasota
Here you go, we go back in Menasota and make more, Taraaa

638
00:50:52,523 --> 00:50:58,256
Wait wait wait, you say we run away?!
Ah I wouldn't call it that. I would call it the happy core memory development program. 

639
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:05,167
You can't be serious! 
Hey, our life was perfect until mom and dad decided to move to San Franstate town

640
00:51:05,803 --> 00:51:09,569
But it's just so drastic.
Need I remind you of how great things were there?

641
00:51:10,153 --> 00:51:17,771
Our room, our backyard, our friends.
TripleDent gum will make you smile ... Did I ask for the gum commercial?!  

642
00:51:18,815 --> 00:51:22,287
Anyway it was better, that's my point.
Yeah, Rylie was happier in Menasota. 

643
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:31,493
Wait, hold on shouldn't we just sleep on this or something?
Fine, let's sleep on it because I'm sure charley funfill times are just around the corner. 

644
00:51:44,423 --> 00:51:47,919
Hey hey why aren't we moving?
Rylie's gone for sleep, we're all on break.

645
00:51:48,611 --> 00:51:51,951
You mean we're stuck here until morning?
Yeah, the train of thoughts doesn't run while she's asleep. 

646
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:54,657
Oh, we can't wait that long.
How about we wake her up?

647
00:51:55,124 --> 00:51:57,558
Sadness, that's ridiculous.
How could we possibly...

648
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:03,322
How about we wake her up?
Great idea, Joy. Thanks, come on.

649
00:52:09,522 --> 00:52:13,287
Wow this place is huge.
Yeah, it looks so much smaller than I expected. 

650
00:52:14,193 --> 00:52:16,928
Wow! "I can fly" I love that one.

651
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,492
Rainbow unicorn! She's right there.


652
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:29,369
My friend says you're famous, she wants your autoraph.
No no, Sadness don't bother miss Unicorn okay?

653
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,514
Sorry, she's from out of town.
It's so embarassing, right?

654
00:52:34,287 --> 00:52:37,100
I loved you in fairy dream adventure part seven, okay bye.
I love you.

655
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:42,182
Ha, I wonder what that means.
Ah well, let's go in.

656
00:52:44,752 --> 00:52:53,164
Set up the room set. Today's memories are in, we gotta a lot of work here.
Rylie dumped her bestfriend, had a miserable day at school and quit hockey.  

657
00:52:53,883 --> 00:52:55,451
The writers are put together a killer's script 

658
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,354
Just because Joy and Sadness are gone I have to do stupid dream duty.

659
00:53:01,526 --> 00:53:06,762
Okay, how are we gonna wake her up?
Well she wakes up sometimes when she has a scary dream, we could scare her. 

660
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:12,369
Scare her?! No no, she's been through enough already.
But Joy. Sadness you may know your way aroud here but I know Rylie. 

661
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:19,797
We're gonna make her so happy, she'll wake up with exhilaration.
We'll exite her awake. Ah that never happened before.  

662
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:22,972
Oh Rylie loves dogs, put this on.
I don't think that will work. 

663
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:27,565
Bing Bong. Yeah?
Donlt let anything happen to these. Got it.

664
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:31,441
Hmmm add the reality distortion filter.


665
00:53:33,602 --> 00:53:38,613
Love it, remember play to the camera everyone.
Rylie is the camera. Make up, get out of there.

666
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,807
We're on in five, four, three... 

667
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:50,495
Hello, class. Before we begin today's pop quiz.
Yeah, she's one of bad address.

668
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:57,378
I want to introduce our new student, Rylie.

669
00:53:58,352 --> 00:54:01,429
Would you like to stand up and introduce yourself?


670
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:09,437
And Rylie, my name is Rylie Anderson
I'm from Menasota and now I live here. 

671
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,700
Euhh! look her teeth are falling out.

672
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,903
That's growth! 
Teeth falling out...

673
00:54:19,192 --> 00:54:22,649
Let me guess, we have no pence on.
Hey look she came to school with no pence on.

674
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:29,958
Ready? I don't think happy is going to work but if we scare her...
Just follow my lead, here we go.

675
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:33,202
park, park, park...

676
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:36,287
What is that?
Ahh what is going on?! 

677
00:54:45,421 --> 00:54:49,629
Ohhh let's party, dance
Ohhh party. 

678
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:54,437
park park...
Joy this is not working.

679
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,828
Sadness, what are you doing?
Come back here.

680
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:07,158
It's just a dream, it's just a dream...

681
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,423
They're trying to wake her up, call security.

682
00:55:13,224 --> 00:55:15,317
Hi Rylie it's me.
Bing Bong?!


683
00:55:16,193 --> 00:55:18,489
Who is your friend who likes to play? Bing Bong...

684
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,842
Sadness, you are ruining this dream, you're scaring her.
But look, it's working

685
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:28,563
Wow! 
They are not part of this dream, get them.

686
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:30,208
Stop right there.

687
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:33,831
Pin away, pin away.

688
00:55:37,431 --> 00:55:39,505
Booohh! pick a part line.

689
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:44,780
You can't do this, I know somebody from the headquarters.

690
00:55:54,994 --> 00:55:56,427
No, no no no...

691
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:59,085
there go the core memories.

692
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:03,222
Come on.

693
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:07,067
What is this place?
The subconscious.

694
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:09,453
That's where they take all the trouble makers.

695
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:17,298
Hmm how do we get in?

696
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:28,599
This is my hat, wait it says my hat? 
That's what I wrote in my hat. What are you talking about?... 

697
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:33,144
Hey you.
Oh, you cought us.

698
00:56:34,712 --> 00:56:36,541
Get back in there. No escaping.

699
00:56:46,793 --> 00:56:50,463
I don't like it here, it's where they keep Rylie's darkest fears.

700
00:56:51,233 --> 00:56:54,188
Ahhhh! It's brocolli.

701
00:56:57,663 --> 00:56:59,165
The stairs to the basement..

702
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,215
Grandma's vacuum cleaner.

703
00:57:11,783 --> 00:57:13,602
Okay, come on.

704
00:57:14,918 --> 00:57:16,503
Would you walk quiter?
I'm trying.

705
00:57:17,594 --> 00:57:21,215
What's going? Candy wrappers?!

706
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,400
Bing Bong!
Joy!

707
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,046
There you are.
Shhhh!

708
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,048
It's Jangles.


709
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,725
Who's the birthday girl...

710
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:03,562
Do you have the core memories?
Yeah, all he cared about was the candy.

711
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,749
We're out of here.
Let's get to that train.

712
00:58:24,558 --> 00:58:28,305
Wait! The train is not running, we still have to wake up Rylie.

713
00:58:29,037 --> 00:58:30,294
But how? 

714
00:58:33,106 --> 00:58:34,511
Oh no!

715
00:58:51,348 --> 00:59:00,759
Hey Sadness, did you hear about the party they were having?
Yeah, yes Joy isn't it a birthday party?

716
00:59:01,472 --> 00:59:07,567
Did you say birthday?
There is cake and presents ... and games and balloons 

717
00:59:08,406 --> 00:59:10,568
Birthday!
Okay, follow us.

718
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,854
Nothing like a good scare to wake you up, right?

719
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,846
Okay but this is my handwriting.
No it isn't, it's my handriting. I wrote that. 

720
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:40,472
Who's the birthday girl?

721
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,262
Come on let's go.

722
00:59:55,132 --> 00:59:55,931
Hahaha we made it.

723
00:59:57,246 --> 00:59:59,311
Guess who is on their way to headquarters?
We are.

724
01:00:07,212 --> 01:00:09,133
What is going on?
He did it again.

725
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:15,833
We were naked and there was a dog, they laughed at us ..
There is Bing Bong and ...

726
01:00:16,368 --> 01:00:18,511
You idiot! It was a dream!
This is ridicoulus.

727
01:00:19,154 --> 01:00:20,703
We can't even get a goodnight sleep anymore.

728
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,809
Time to take action.
Stupid mom and dad, if they hadn't move us, none of this would have happened.

729
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,903
Who's with me?

730
01:00:32,972 --> 01:00:34,513
Yeah, let's do it.

731
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:48,597
She took it, there is no turning back.

732
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:51,294
So how are we gonna get to Menasota from here?

733
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,657
Well why won't we go down to the elephant lot and ride an elephant?
Hey, that sounds nice. 

734
01:00:56,201 --> 01:00:57,760
We're taking the bus!

735
01:00:59,959 --> 01:01:01,665
There is a bus leaving tomorrow, perfect.

736
01:01:02,065 --> 01:01:03,681
A ticket costs money, how do we get money?

737
01:01:04,314 --> 01:01:05,726
Mom's purse.

738
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:07,654
Ahhh you wouldn't!
Ah, but I would.

739
01:01:08,024 --> 01:01:09,154
Where was it we saw it last?

740
01:01:10,858 --> 01:01:12,464
TripleDent gum will make you...
Noooooo!

741
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:17,208
It's down stairs somewhere, mom and dad got us into this mess, they can pay to get us out.

742
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:24,531
How about this ha? Isn't it nice?
You can see everything from up here.

743
01:01:24,988 --> 01:01:30,342
Look, there is inductive reasoning.
There is deja vu, there is language processing, there is deja vu.

744
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:34,893
There is critical thinking, there is deja vu .. and look at this guy's memories... 

745
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:43,686
Hey, that was a good idea .. about scaring Rylie awake.
You're not so bad. Really?   

746
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:51,826
Nice work.
Ah, I can't wait to get the old Rylie back, as soon as we get there I'm gonna fix this whole mess.

747
01:01:52,714 --> 01:01:57,389
Wow is this Rylie? She's so big now, she won't fit in my rocket
how are we gonna get to the moon?!

748
01:01:58,178 --> 01:02:03,953
Oh it's that time in the twisty tree, remember?
The hockey team showed up and mom and dad were there cheering. 

749
01:02:05,248 --> 01:02:09,464
Look at her, having fun and laughing.
Ahhh I love this one.

750
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:18,618
Hmmm I love that one too. Oh girl, now you're getting it.
Yeah, it was the day that Perry dogs lost the big playoff game 

751
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:22,524
Rylie missed the winning shot, she felt awful, she wanted to quit. 

752
01:02:24,743 --> 01:02:26,652
Sorry, I went sad again, didn't I?

753
01:02:28,269 --> 01:02:32,525
I'll tell you what ... we can keep working on that when we get back, okay?
Okay.

754
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,143
why did our moving van even go to texas?!

755
01:02:46,828 --> 01:02:48,204
Multiple customers...

756
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:57,276
But you promised delivery on the fifth... 

757
01:03:01,335 --> 01:03:03,274
Aha..

758
01:03:07,685 --> 01:03:10,320
Exuse me, isn't there anyway that you can rush it?

759
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:17,390
Honesty island!

760
01:03:26,325 --> 01:03:27,621
Look out!

761
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:59,674
That was our way home, we lost another island, what is happening?!

762
01:04:00,475 --> 01:04:03,924
Haven't you heard? Rylie is running away.
What?! 

763
01:04:06,367 --> 01:04:11,206
Wait wait, hang on guys are we really doing this?
I mean this is serious.

764
01:04:11,823 --> 01:04:16,740
Look, we have no core memories.
You want Rylie to be happy? Let's get back to Menasota and make more.

765
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:20,598
Joy if we hurry we can still stop her.

766
01:04:22,873 --> 01:04:24,279
Family island. Let's go.

767
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:43,196
Joy, it's too dangerous, we won't make it in time.

768
01:04:47,453 --> 01:04:49,118
But that's our only way back!

769
01:05:01,404 --> 01:05:02,896
A recall tube! 

770
01:05:05,314 --> 01:05:06,549
We can get recalled.

771
01:05:10,629 --> 01:05:11,945
Have a great day, sweetheart.

772
01:05:12,782 --> 01:05:15,024
See you after school monkey.
Woo woo woo

773
01:05:15,405 --> 01:05:16,465
We love you.

774
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,687
Go run run goo

775
01:05:32,314 --> 01:05:36,581
Sadness stop, you're hurting Rylie

776
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:48,981
Oh no, I did it again.
If you get in here, these core memories will get sad. I'm sorry. 

777
01:05:50,393 --> 01:05:52,682
Rylie needs to be happy.
Joy!

778
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:09,109
Joy!

779
01:06:13,277 --> 01:06:14,828
Joy! 

780
01:07:02,911 --> 01:07:05,184
Joy, Joy what are you doing?
Would you stop it please?

781
01:07:09,647 --> 01:07:12,093
Don't you get it Joy?! 
We're stuck down here.

782
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,539
We're forgotten.

783
01:07:24,136 --> 01:07:35,150
We used to play tag and stuff but things are different now since we moved...

784
01:08:06,741 --> 01:08:11,713
Do you remember how she used to stick her tongue out when she was colouring?

785
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:25,307
I could listen to her stories all day.

786
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:41,247
I just wanted Rylie to be happy.

787
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:51,962
It was the day that Perry Dogs lost the big playoff game, Rylie missed the winning shot.
She felt awful, she wanted to quit 

788
01:10:10,559 --> 01:10:20,958
Sadness! Mom and dad! the team!
They came to help because of Sadness. 

789
01:10:27,386 --> 01:10:28,626
We have to get back up there.

790
01:10:30,098 --> 01:10:31,530
Joy, we're stuck down here.

791
01:10:33,255 --> 01:10:34,697
We might as well be on another planet.

792
01:10:40,891 --> 01:10:42,022
Another planet!  

793
01:10:45,286 --> 01:10:47,332
Who's your friend who likes to play? 

794
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:53,293
Who's your friend who likes to play?

795
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:56,751
His rocket makes you yell horray!

796
01:11:00,763 --> 01:11:02,965
Who's the best who likes....

797
01:11:04,863 --> 01:11:06,881

01:12:56,598 --> 01:13:01,038
You made it!
Go, go save Rylie.

806
01:13:04,769 --> 01:13:07,517
Take her to the moon for me, Okay?

807
01:13:21,863 --> 01:13:24,014
I'll try Bing Bong.

808
01:13:26,846 --> 01:13:27,901
I promise.

809
01:13:41,924 --> 01:13:43,056
We're home.

810
01:13:44,078 --> 01:13:44,875
Rylie!

811
01:13:46,151 --> 01:13:46,979
Rylie!

812
01:13:51,213 --> 01:13:52,305
I'll call her cell.

813
01:13:56,002 --> 01:13:57,008
Oh this is terrible.

814
01:13:57,785 --> 01:13:59,500
Wait is this one walking towards us? Let's cross the street.

815
01:14:04,757 --> 01:14:10,091
It's mom, she's on to us. What do we do?
Rylie needs to get core memories, we keep going.

816
01:14:13,895 --> 01:14:14,882
Sadness!

817
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:32,611
Sadness! Sadness, come on Sadness where are you?
Okay if I were Sadness were would I be?

818
01:14:33,476 --> 01:14:40,103
Oh everything is awful and my legs don't work and 
you have to drag me around...

819
01:14:58,609 --> 01:15:00,140
Oh no it's mom again, what do we do?

820
01:15:06,661 --> 01:15:09,344
This is madness, she shouldn't run away.
Let's get this idea out of her head.

821
01:15:11,085 --> 01:15:15,700
Sadness Sadness!
Joy!

822
01:15:17,239 --> 01:15:20,197
Wait Sadness.
Just let me go. 

823
01:15:21,014 --> 01:15:23,360
Rylie is better off without me.
Come back.

824
01:15:29,519 --> 01:15:32,214
Hey you're saying your husband was blown away by an elephant.

825
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:34,997
Was he with anyone?
Yes, and there she is.

826
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,753
Hey, come back here.
Forget it Jake, it's cloud town.

827
01:15:44,095 --> 01:15:46,901
Sadness! 
I make everything worse.

828
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:49,606
Wait Sadness, we gotta get you back to...

829
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:02,828
Oh it's stuck!
Oh great! What, what do you mean it's stuck?!

830
01:16:03,334 --> 01:16:05,388
No what? No no no
What is this?!

831
01:16:15,045 --> 01:16:18,094
How do we stop it? I got it, make her feel scared 
that will make her change her mind.

832
01:16:18,747 --> 01:16:22,309
Brilliant! I know it's brilliant, do it.
It's not working, why isn't it woking?!

833
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:24,225
Let me try.
Let me do it. 

834
01:16:30,539 --> 01:16:33,869
Noo. Guys we can't make Rylie feel anything.

835
01:16:35,056 --> 01:16:36,449
What have we done?!

836
01:16:37,382 --> 01:16:42,297
Hey look at me, did you mean what you said before.
I would die for Rylie, I would die for Rylie.

837
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,730
Okay haircut, time to proove it.

838
01:16:48,065 --> 01:16:50,151
I would die for Rylie... I would die for Rylie...

839
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:10,466
That's it, I've hold.

840
01:17:41,735 --> 01:17:44,752
This is crazy, this is crazy...
No no, Joy be positive.

841
01:17:48,935 --> 01:17:50,671
I'm positive this is crazy.

842
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:58,126
Now! 
For Ryliiiee.

843
01:18:05,390 --> 01:18:07,105
Joy! 
Hang on.

844
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,365
I wish Joy was here.

845
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,294
It's Joy.

846
01:18:19,956 --> 01:18:21,133
Stand back.

847
01:18:22,691 --> 01:18:23,431
That worked.

848
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:28,333
Well what would you do if you're so smart?
I'd tell you but you're too dump to understand.

849
01:18:29,473 --> 01:18:36,994
Of course your tiny brain is confused, I guess I'll have to
dump it down to your level. Sorry I don't speak moron as you but let me try.

850
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:52,895
We found this idea, now Rylie...

851
01:19:03,629 --> 01:19:06,344
Joy you have to fix this, get up there.
Sadness, it's up to you.

852
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,653
Me?! Sadness! Sadness! 

853
01:19:09,565 --> 01:19:12,593
I can't Joy.
Yes you can, Rylie needs you.

854
01:19:25,465 --> 01:19:26,733
Okay.

855
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:49,554
Wait stop.
I wanna get off.

856
01:20:01,537 --> 01:20:04,621
Alright, thank you. We will.
Her teacher hasn't even seen Rylie all day.

857
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:07,260
What?! What was she wearing last? Do you remember...

858
01:20:08,796 --> 01:20:12,409
Rylie! We were worried sick, were have you been? It's so late.

859
01:21:46,555 --> 01:22:10,950
I know you don't want me to but ... I miss home.
I miss Menasota, you need me to be happy but ... I want my old friends and my hockey team. I wanna go home.  

860
01:22:13,287 --> 01:22:27,994
Please don't be mad. Oh sweetie, we're not mad.
You know what? I miss Menasota too. I miss the woods..   

861
01:22:28,988 --> 01:22:40,846
And the backyard where you used to play, spring lake where you learned to skate.
Come here. 

862
01:24:02,138 --> 01:24:07,473
Hey I'm liking this new view, friendship island expanded.
Gladly finally opened that friendly argument section.

863
01:24:08,027 --> 01:24:12,076
I like the vampire tragic romance island.
Fashion island, everyone shut up. 

864
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:17,519
Boyband island?! I hope that's just a phase.
Say what you want, I think it's all beautiful.

865
01:24:19,059 --> 01:24:23,937
Alright here you go, your new expanded console is up and running.
Woahhhh! 

866
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:27,674
Oh upgrade.
Hey, whoah oops!

867
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:30,546
Did I just do that?
Guys, what's puberty?

868
01:24:31,403 --> 01:24:33,690
No it's probably not important.

869
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:39,404
I have access to the entire curse word library.
This new console is...

870
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:42,304
Sorry I did it again, my bad.

871
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:50,988
You go out there, you be agressive.
Not too agressive, you know you guys don't have to come every game!

872
01:24:51,678 --> 01:24:57,071
Are you kidding? I'm not missing one.
Go Rylie. I gotta go.

873
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:04,686
Yeah mom and dad are pretty cool.
Guys of course they are but we can't show it.

874
01:25:06,906 --> 01:25:13,661
She loved this, I told you it's a great idea.
Best idea he's had in a while, he's a really good guy.

875
01:25:19,217 --> 01:25:20,493
Just in case.

876
01:25:24,093 --> 01:25:25,135
Sorry.


877
01:25:27,324 --> 01:25:30,222
Girl girl girl...

878
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:35,732
Okay, bye.

879
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,112
You ready? Yeah.
Let's play some hockey.

880
01:25:53,742 --> 01:25:56,399
On her left, on her left.
Let's just try not get too smelly this time.

881
01:26:02,002 --> 01:26:09,400
We've been trough a lot lately, that's for sure but we still love our girl.
She has great new friends, a great new house, things couldn't be better.  

882
01:26:10,325 --> 01:26:13,489
After all Rylie is twelve now, what could happen?

883
01:26:35,296 --> 01:26:47,477
and who could tell me at what year San Fransisco was founded?
Anyone? Ohhh, how much more of this? 5 months, 2 weeks and 4 days until summer vacation.

884
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:50,162
then we're up to the bahamas with you know who.

885
01:26:51,914 --> 01:26:55,554
Come fly with me Gargenia...
Ahhhh

886
01:26:58,704 --> 01:27:05,577
Have a nice day.
What are we mad about? I don't know...

887
01:27:08,165 --> 01:27:09,432
I know, totally

888
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:14,390
We were total frod, do you think they can see through us?
Of course not, we're wearing eye shadow.

889
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:27,256
Who's the birthday girl? Ha?
Hey, hello. Six years of drama school for this!

890
01:27:34,867 --> 01:27:39,764
Okay this is fine, we just need to go to our happy place...
TripleDent gum will make you smile...
