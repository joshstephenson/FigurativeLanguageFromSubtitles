45
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,808
COXWAIN: Correct?

46
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,606
That's the way we saw each other
at 7:00 this morning.

47
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,524
We were brainwashed.

48
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,746
I can't believe
you can't get me out of this.

49
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,417
It's so absurd
I have to be here on a Saturday.

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,421
It's not like
I'm a defective or anything.

51
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,340
I'll make it up to you.

52
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,885
Honey, ditching class to go shopping
doesn't make you a defective.

53
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,929
Have a good day.

54
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,728
Is this the first
or last time we do this?

55
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,230
Last.
